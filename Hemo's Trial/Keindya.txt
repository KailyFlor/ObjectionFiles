**Chapter 1: Decisions**

-As Undya Griber woke up to the melodic sound of her alarm clock, she had no idea that this day would await her with more than one unexpected event. Especially since it began just like any other day.

Slowly, the teenage girl opened her eyes.  She reached out to her phone from which the alarm sound originated. Still blinded by the sunlight trespassing the curtains of her room's large windows, she disabled the alarm with a swipe. Squinting, she read the digits on the screen -

(**Undya thinking:** Mmm… seven-fifteen... 🥱 )

-She yawned, then checked her weather app -

(**Undya thinking:** Just as hot as yesterday 😑 Annnd… right, today is Ciranday :kthinking:… so no Healing class :kthinking:… sooo I can wear light colors 😌 But well… gotta get up before Mari does… 🥱:yaonion:)

-She stretched in bed one more time, then got up and walked to her wardrobe to pick a basic outfit: Plain white t-shirt, black shorts, a bralette in an equivalent size to an A cup in our world, a matching panty, and short white socks. With her clothes assembled, she left her room and went into the bathroom that was luckily empty. Ten minutes later, she came out, freshly showered, her light-blond pixie-cut hair combed, and with mascara surrounding her mercury eyes. 

Just as she was about to head downstairs, a red-haired head popped out of the guest room. Undya turned around with a smile -

**Undya:** Good morning, Mari 😁 The bathroom is all yours. :ukawaii:

-Visibly sleepy, the red-haired girl greeted her back -

**Marina:** Good morning 🥱 Can you make me some coffee please? 😴

**Undya:** Sure :syaogo: Would've done that anyway :ukawaii: 😘 See ya downstairs 😉

**Marina:** Thanks, girl, you're a true friend :upatpat: :yaonion:

-Mari mumbled, smiling shyly, and disappeared into the bathroom. -


[5/22/2023 12:01 AM] frangipani.
-With a skip in her step, Undya came down the stairs and followed her father’s voice to the kitchen. When she arrived there, she saw that both her parents and her brother were already in the midst of breakfast. Her father had a cup of black tea and a newspaper spread in front of him on the table, and was talking to her mother, who was listening attentively while chewing on a sandwich. Both of them were wearing their work clothes - her dad was sporting a freshly ironed suit and tie, her mom her standard green nurse uniform -; her brother, on the other hand, had messy hair, dirty clothes and dark rings under his eyes. He looked up from his phone, as Undya entered the room, while their dad interrupted himself to greet his daughter -

**Undya’s dad:** Good morning, my little evergreen flower! :yaoc: Did you sleep well? :upatpat:

**Undya:** Good morning, Dad! :klove: I slept excellently, as you would say :ukawaii: Good morning, Mom! :sheart:

**Undya’s mom:** Good morning, sweetie! :sheart:

-She quickly hugged both her parents, then pretended to want to hug her brother but instead gently pricked his sides with her index fingers. He flinched, then cracked a slight smile, tried to poke her back but she nimbly managed to avoid it -

**Undya:** And good morning to you, slowpoke :yao: :malote: You look like you need coffee even more urgently than Mari :yaoc: :ukawaii:

**Undya’s mom:** Dynlak came home half an hour ago, the poor boy hasn’t slept at all 😟

-Dynlak frowned and mumbled a reply while Undya started to prepare the coffee -

**Dynlak:** I’ll be fine, Mom, I’ll just sleep early tonight :really:


[5/22/2023 12:04 AM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Did you have fun though? :syaogo: If yes, it was worth it anyways 😉

-She asked, as she pressed the “Start” button on the coffee machine. Behind her, Dynlak’s face brightened up in response to her question -

**Dynlak:** Fuck yeah :excelente:  First we went… :idea:

**Undya’s mom:** Honey, don’t say such crude words :yaogo:

**Dynlak:** Urgh 🙄 😒

-Dynlak rolled his eyes, visibly annoyed by his mother’s interruption -

(**Undya thinking:** Uh-oh, he really hasn’t slept at all :e_e:. If he’s in this state, Mom should be careful not to trigger him 😅 :e_e:)

-Undya thought while removing the full coffee pot from the machine-

**Dynlak:** Whatever 🙄 First, we went to our standard bar until it was, like, midnight, then we spontaneously decided to go to another bar that Radak’s girlfriend recommended, then we stayed there for another three hours till the bar closed, and then we went to Toman’s place and hung out in there until everyone either went home or fell asleep :idea: :yao: :yaonion:

-While listening to Dynlak, Undya placed the coffee pot in front of herself on the kitchen counter, rubbed her hands together for a few seconds to create warmth between her hands. She stopped and took a deep breath, focusing on the energy between her palms, making it increase just a bit. A moment passed, as she quickly placed her warm hands on both sides of the coffee pot, and slowly breathed out, feeling how the warm Healing energy left her hands and passed through the pot into the coffee -


[5/22/2023 12:08 AM] frangipani.
(**Undya thinking:** Just a tiny bit, for Dynlak’s and Mari’s immune systems 😓 I know they both don’t sleep enough 😅… and I'm sure they wouldn’t mind feeling less physical consequences 😅:yaonion:)

-Dynlak watched his sister use Healing on the coffee,  but neither seemed to realize nor to care. Instead he finished his report about last night-

**Dynlak:** I was the last one that left :idea:. Had an interesting conversation with my band boys, about our future’n’stuff :yaoc:

**Undya’s dad:** Your… future, you said? 🤔 Does that mean you guys are going to dissolve the band? 🧐

-Dynlak frowned again as Undya brought the coffee to the table and couldn’t help but feel nervous about where this was going -

(**Undya thinking:** :e_e: Please, Dad, I know you don’t like his band, but DON’T be so straightforward, not right now 😅)

**Dynlak:** Nope, Dad 🙄, quite the opposite actually :malote:, we were talking about how we can bring our music to… THOSE guys. :idea:

-He bent over and put his finger on the main article on the right side of the newspaper, the header of which read: “COLLABORATION WITH THE NAORI COMMAND CONTINUES TO BE A SUCCESS - Academic partnership extended to secondary schools in Ecuia City”. Below, there was a group photo of two Naoris, as noticeable by their uniforms, together with the president of Ecuia and the mayor of Ecuia City. Undya’s father looked confused.-


[5/22/2023 12:11 AM] frangipani.
**Undya’s dad:** To the President and the Mayor? 🧐

**Dynlak:** *chuckles* Nope, the other guys :yaoc:

**Undya’s dad:** To the… Naoris??! 🤨 😳

-He reacted with an irritated face, as Undya’s mom raised her eyebrows in surprise -

**Dynlak:** Yup :yaoc:. We’ve done some research about both the Naori Command and Cintre, and noticed that there might be a huge market for Lurian musicians over there :idea: See, the Cintreans are very work-focused people, and they don’t have time to go to concerts or make music themselves. But after our last concert, we talked to a Cintrean, and he said that one of his favorite things here in Luria is how the arts are such an integral part of people’s lives, and that Cintreans LOVE the musical variety on our planet :idea:, so… :idea:

-His mother interrupted him again-

**Undya’s mom:** A Cintrean at your concert? 😳

**Dynlak:** Yeah :yao:, he was wearing casual clothing and looked like an average person from the crowd, and then revealed himself to be a Cintrean during our meet-and-greet :yaoc:

**Undya’s dad:** Are you sure that was a real Cintrean then? :maybe: As far as I know, they only wear uniforms, as they care a lot about their work and reputation, which does not necessarily go well with visiting rock concerts. 🧐


[5/22/2023 12:15 AM] frangipani.
**Undya’s mom:** That’s right. I’m afraid their culture is like that, honey 😅 Maybe that person was a drunk pretending to be a Cintrean :yaogo:

-Undya decided to comment-

**Undya:** Actually, Cintreans can be wearing casual outfits, in order to blend in with the common Ecuians :sidea:. We had that topic at Global Education class once :yaoc:

-She said with confidence while making herself a sandwich. Her father eyed her suspiciously while lifting his cup to drink from it, and Dynlak looked at his sister with an expression that said, "thanks", before turning his attention back to their parents-

**Dynlak:** See? At least she's believing me :yao: :yaoc: And the guy was legit! He even gave us his contact address and told us to hit him up before our next concert :yao:. And that got all of us thinking 🤔 : What if we start saving money, and find a way to travel to and perform... on Cintre? :idea:

-Hearing those words, Undya froze. Their dad almost spat out his black tea, and their mom’s jaw dropped-

**Undya’s dad:** PFF– 😳 😵‍💫  *coughs*

**Undya’s mom:** Did you just say… ON Cintre?!? The PLANET Cintre?!?!  😳 😱

**Dynlak:** That’d be the long term goal, yeah :yaoc:


[5/22/2023 12:21 AM] frangipani.
-Their dad cleared his throat, his facial expression turning into a frown-

**Undya’s dad:** That’s NOT going to happen! :serio: 😠 

**Undya’s mom:** You cannot travel to Cintre, honey, that is way too dangerous! 😟

**Dynlak:** Relax, Cintreans travel to space all the time :yaoc:, it’d be easy for them to take us with them… :idea:

**Undya’s dad:** You want to put your trust into the hands of an alien culture?! 😳 😠 Do you even know how risky that is?! :mface: 

-He responded, raising his voice at his son while Undya felt more and more uncomfortable. Dynlak made a defensive gesture with his hands and replied-

**Dynlak:** Whoa, Dad 😅, trust me, we’ve worked on this plan all night, and believe me, we’ve taken everything into account… 😅:yaogo:

-His father rose from the table, causing his chair to fall down behind him with a crash, and yelled at Dynlak-

**Undya’s dad:** You’ve taken NOTHING into account! 😡💢  How many times have I talked to you about Cintreans, and Naoris, and WHATEVER all of these people are called, and how many times have I told you that it’s too dangerous for us to BLINDLY TRUST THEM?!?! 😡 Their technology is MUCH more advanced than ours, and yet they treat their people like means to an inhuman end, slaves to a meritocratic system that punishes those who haven’t burned out yet, and becomes the death of those who have!! :loco: And now my only son wants to sacrifice himself for people who will neither acknowledge nor pay him, because he doesn’t get that Cintreans DON’T CARE ABOUT HIS MUSIC!!! :loco: 😤 🤬 

-He screamed, his face red with anger.-

-Dynlak’s facial expression started to change, and slowly morphed into the same wrathful one his father had. Witnessing the anger taking over Dynlak, Undya felt a shot of anxiety rush through her-


[5/22/2023 12:25 AM] frangipani.
(**Undya thinking:** Oh crap, he didn’t manage to block Dad’s emotions :e_e:… and now they are taking control of his own! 😰)

-Dynlak abruptly jumped up the same way his father had. His chair crashed against the floor, but Undya's brother was louder as he screamed at his father-

**Dynlak:** I KNOW THEY CARE!!! 😠 :mface: I have witnessed it myself!! I WILL perform for the Cintreans, and you will SEE that I was RIGHT and ADMIT that you are wrong!! 😠

**Undya’s dad:** I have ENOUGH proof for my distrust towards Cintreans while you have NOTHING but a naive statement from a random stranger who most probably pranked you! 😠💢 You have NOTHING to back up your claims!! :mface:

-Hearing those words, Undya couldn’t help but worry-

(**Undya thinking:** Oh no, this is escalating… 😰 And Mari might come downstairs at any moment 😱 I need to find a way to fix this asap 😰… wait a moment 😳... Dynlak DOES have proof… he has the Cintrean’s address :kthinking: If he shows it to Dad, he might trust Dynlak a bit more… :kthinking: )

-Undya opened her mouth to intervene, but her mom was faster. She stood up as well and spoke to Dynlak in a calm but stern tone-

**Undya’s mom:** You’re not going to perform for the Cintreans, Dynlak. Not under our watch. :sserio:

-Now Dynlak completely lost his nerves -

**Dynlak:** ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? :loco: 😡 I AM TWENTY FUCKING YEARS OLD! :loco: I’m a fucking adult, and YOU still think I would CARE if YOU don’t ALLOW me to do something?!?! 🤬  I’m gonna move out of this place as SOON as I can! :loco: 😤


[5/22/2023 12:30 AM] frangipani.
-Undya started to feel extremely unwell. She knew that this might be the last moment in which de-escalation was possible-

(**Undya thinking:** Gotta be brave~ 😣)

-She slowly stood up and commented-

**Undya:** A-actually, about what Dynlak said… :sidea:😅

**Undya’s dad:** YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!! 🫵😠 

-Her father shouted at her. Immediately, Undya shut her mouth and sat down again. Her father immediately turned back to his son and started a rant about no matter how old he'd be, Dynlak would still be his and his wife’s son, and that they were still responsible for keeping him safe if he were to do anything reckless. Undya's mother supported his statements, and Dynlak, still full of anger, tried his best to counter. Undya, however, had stopped listening. She was busy holding back tears.-

-Even though she was not an Empath like her brother, she could feel how deeply her father’s anger had hit her.
But his anger hadn't managed to infect her. Instead, it had transformed into hurt.
Hurt that her parents and her brother, three people whom she loved deeply, were fighting.
Hurt that she was neither allowed nor capable of calming them down.
Hurt that her father, who had smiled at her and called her his “little evergreen flower” just five minutes ago, had now looked at her with eyes full of wrath, and yelled at her in a voice that hadn’t even sounded like his anymore.-

-Suddenly, her parents and Dynlak stopped talking. Undya looked up and saw a red-haired figure stand in the doorframe of the kitchen. Marina was fully dressed, but her make-up didn’t hide the awkward feeling she must have had, barging into a room with a fighting family in it.-

-Undya’s mother tried to put on a happy face, but her voice sounded deeply embarrassed:-

**Undya’s mom:** Oh, Marina, good morning! 😅 Don’t mind us, we just had a… small disagreement, but we’ve JUST managed to settle it :yaogo: :yaonion:


[5/22/2023 12:32 AM] frangipani.
-She stuttered, then looked at her husband and her son. Undya knew that her facial expression said, “Not a word about this in front of non-family members!” Luckily for her, her husband immediately got in on the cause-

**Undya’s dad:** Yes, indeed. :yaogo: We are sorry if it sounded like an argument to you, but as you know, I’m a lawyer, so I have a very assertive way to express myself :yaogo:. Come, sit down, Undya has made some immunity-boosting coffee for you, and here are some bread and sandwich ingredients on the table :yaoc:

**Marina:** O-oh, I see. 😅 Thanks :yaogo:

-She sat down next to Undya, who noticed that she didn’t look too convinced. The rest of the family sat down too. Dynlak silently stared at the table with a bright red face that had a hint of sadness in it -

(**Undya thinking:** Poor girl had to witness some of this 😟, what if she saw that I was just a bystander? 😢 That I was just watching and silently suffering while my family was picking each other apart? 😢 I had an idea, and I could have stopped it, but… 😣 Why did I allow Dad… to silence me?  😢)

-While Undya was still lost inside her own thoughts, the camera cut away from her, and instead zoomed in on a smaller article on her father’s newspaper, next to the one Dynlak had pointed out. Its headline said, “WEGA ACADEMY CHOSEN FOR NEW PROJECT WITH THE NAORI COMMAND”...-


[5/22/2023 6:46 PM] frangipani.
-The image of the newspaper article faded into another scene, and slowly zoomed out, revealing another kitchen setting. There, a middle-aged man with a balding, copper-haired head, taupe-colored eyes, and a pair of reading glasses was sitting at the kitchen table. He appeared to be reading the article about the collaboration between Wega Academy and the Naori command with great interest and a content look on his face.
-The camera then focused on an official-looking letter that was lying next to the newspaper. It had the logo of the Naori Command printed on it, and was addressed to: "Morys Sayko, Director of Wega Academy".-

-The man looked up as audible footsteps were approaching, and just a moment later, a teenage boy appeared in the kitchen. He looked handsome and well-groomed, and his mane-like copper-colored hair was voluminous and styled fashionably, contrasting with his bright, emerald-green eyes. His facial features, however, clearly gave away his relation to the man at the kitchen table-

**Handsome boy:** Good morning, father 😇

-He said nonchalantly before taking a seat at the table opposed to his father, who raised his eyebrows at him and smiled amusedly-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Good morning, Indys 😌, why so formal today? :yao: Does “dad” not suffice anymore? :yao::yaogo:

**Indys:** As you said last weekend, today’s youth should show their elders more respect :idea: :yaogo: 😉 

-He replied in a playful tone, making his father chuckle slightly-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Anyway, “son” :yao:, your mother sends you her greetings :yaoc:

**Indys:** Oh, neat, send her some back ☺️ 🥰. Is her class trip going well? 👀


[5/22/2023 6:53 PM] frangipani.
**Principal Morys Sayko:** According to her text message from earlier, she is doing fine :yaoc:. There was one Talent outbreak yesterday, which she was thankfully prepared for, since the mean age in this class is just above thirteen :idea: :yaogo:. Luckily it was a Shielder, so she could use her own experience to calm down and educate the kid :idea: :yaoc:

-Indys nodded attentively while sipping coffee, then replied-

**Indys:** Oh, that's very lucky :yaoc: You seem to be happy about it too :idea: :yaogo:, or is there anything else? 🤨 You are in a surprisingly good mood in comparison to yesterday :yao:

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Indeed there is :idea:

-With a swift movement, he turned the newspaper upside down on the table, so that his son could read what it said. Then he pointed at the small article that had Wega Academy in it.-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** It's in the news :idea:, which means that it's official 😁 My Academy was chosen for collaboration with the Utam Institute and the Naori Command 🤩 🥳! Can you believe how much that will boost the reputation of both Wega Academy and its graduates :idea:... and even my own? :yao::yaonion:


[5/23/2023 8:08 PM] frangipani.
-He proclaimed in a very cheerful voice, gesturing with both arms to the sides which expressed happiness, relief, and the desire to share those emotions.
Upon hearing his father’s words, Indys’ eyes widened, and his lips formed a grin.-

**Indys:** That’s so amazing, dad! 😁 Congratulations! 😃 👏 I'm so envious of you! :yaonion:

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Thanks, son 🤩! Be envious indeed :idea: :malote:, for it will be a singular experience for me, my students and the six teachers I will pick as chaperones :yaoc:.

-Indys looked a bit sour as his father said, "be envious", as if he was responding to a command. Then, another part of his dad's explanation caught his attention-

**Indys:** Six teachers?! 😳 Why so many? Are you going to make the entire school participate in the project? :yao: :yaogo:

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Not at all :yao:, in fact, I am only allowed to invite fifteen students of my own choice. My fellow project leader from the Naoris will be Tedu Kas Omou, a Nep rank and the second head of the nurid program of the Naori command :idea: :excelente:. He is going to invite fifteen students of the Utam Institute as well :idea: The reason why I want six teachers to be present alongside me, is for each of us to represent one of the Talents, which the Naori students are most likely unfamiliar with :yaoc:

**Indys:** Wait, a Nep rank? 😳 Wasn’t that, like, one of the highest ranks? 😲


[5/23/2023 8:12 PM] frangipani.
**Principal Morys Sayko:** Correct, and one of the rarest :idea: :yaoc: His official title is NN-2 NRP… :idea:

**Indys:** Dad, stop :yao: :yaonion:, I’ve heard you do your Seeker flex ten-thousand times already :yaonion:, next time show it to the Nep rank instead 😂 😂 😂 :malote: :yaonion: 

-His dad smiled, visibly enjoying that he was joking around with his son. Then, an abrupt silence fell between the two of them, in which the principal resumed his breakfast while Indys carefully read the article. Enough silence for the principal, however, to pick up that there was some kind of tension in the air…-

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Hmmm…🤨 something is off about him today 🧐 There has to be something going on with him, but I cannot put my finger on what it could be 🤔 🧐)

-His thoughts were interrupted by Indys asking another question-

**Indys:** Sooo… when are you going to meet the Naoris? :yaogo: 🤔

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Oh, ehm, well :yaoc:, this Suranday already :idea: :yaogo:, so I am going to be busy with a large number of preparations during the next three days :yao: :pressf: Thus, I’m afraid you won’t see much of me until your mother’s return, and you will probably have to cook dinner for yourself. But don’t worry, unlike your mother, I trust your skills in the kitchen :yaoc:, at least with what I can see of your knowledge :yaonion: :yaogo:


[5/23/2023 8:18 PM] frangipani.
**Indys:** Hah, yeah :yao:, thanks, I guess 😅 :yaonion:

-Indys replied, letting out a short laugh that rather resembled a snort… which made his father even more suspicious-

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Hmm, that was his fake laughter 🤨. So I WAS right that something is going on with him 🤔 Could it be because of a guy? :maybe: Should I ask him about it? 🤔 On the other hand... his private life is none of my business 😅 :yaonion:, and he is obviously trying to hide whatever it is from me :yaogo: He will be fine :yaonion:... or will he? 🤔)

-Unaware of his father's speculation, Indys inquired another thing-

**Indys:** Have you picked the students yet, by the way? 🤔 There have to be fifteen, right? :idea: Are there any… inclusion criteria? :yaogo: 😅

**Principal Morys Sayko:** To summarize the answers :idea:: no, yes, and yes :yaonion:. I haven’t made my selection of fifteen students yet because I wanted to wait for having both the confirmation from the press and from the Naori Command, which I now have :idea:

-He explained, gesticulating towards the newspaper, that was still upside-down facing Indys, and the letter from the command on the table in front of the principal himself-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** About the inclusion criteria :idea: : Elligible students have to be at around your age and in your grade :idea: And they preferably should have a network of friends and social contacts which I can invite as well, since teamwork will be crucial :idea: So there is a chance that your friends Yohan and Mihayl, and some others from your social network at Wega Academy will be added to the list :idea:. Isn’t that great? :yaoc:


[5/23/2023 8:20 PM] frangipani.
-For a millisecond, Indys stopped smiling, but then quickly nodded and put another grin on… one that, however, gave him away...-

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Wait a minute... what is off about that smile? 🤨 He’s not smiling with his eyes 🧐… Ohhhh 😳 :e_e: I think I finally get it :e_e::derp:. Is he… sad that he cannot participate in the project? 😳)


[5/23/2023 10:54 PM] frangipani.
-The camera zoomed close to the principal’s serious face, then switched into a flashback with the caption: “ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO”.
The flashback was set in the living room of the Sayko family: A younger-looking Indys, the principal, who still had much more hair back then, and his wife aka Indys’ mother, a pretty woman with wheat-colored hair and emerald-green eyes, were sitting on the couch watching a TV program featuring news about the Naori Command-

**News reporter (Flashback):** …According to reports from the Intergalactic Communication Ministry, the Naori Command has been following every agreement that has been settled between the Ecuian government and the head of the Naoris in the Treaty of Ecuia :idea:. Despite the initial distrust towards the Naoris in many parts of the population, they seem to have indeed come in peace :idea: :ulike:.

-Indys turned towards his parents with a bright expression on his face-

**Indys (Flashback):** See, mom? They’re harmless, I knew it :idea: :malote:

-Indys’ mother gave him an unimpressed stare and replied-

**Indys’ mom (Flashback):** They have been here for six months. That is not long enough to reveal their true intentions :sserio: Remember they are highly advanced, so it is still possible that they could try to exploit our resources because they are running out of such, and then disappear before we'd even notice :kthinking: :sserio:.


[5/23/2023 10:57 PM] frangipani.
-With that comment, she got up, took an empty bowl that had previously had some chips in it, and went out of the living room into the kitchen. The principal bowed towards his son and whispered-

**Principal Morys Sayko (Flashback):** Don’t tell her, but I agree with you :yaogo:. Their technology is incredibly far ahead, thus they could have obliterated our planet or stolen our resources in a blink of an eye if they had wanted to. The fact that they haven’t made any attempt to do so, and always tried their best to have good diplomatic relations with every country on Luria, is a good sign :yaoc:

-Indys whispered back just as quietly-

**Indys (Flashback):** Do you think it is possible that… even common folk like me or my friends could meet the Naoris one day? :yaogo: 🤔 Like, in the context of an internship or something? 🤔

**Principal Morys Sayko (Flashback):** Why not, they are already visiting our universities in order to get to know our education system :yaoc:. Just give it some more time, the Naoris have barely arrived here :yao: :yaoc:

**Indys’ mom (Flashback):** *from the kitchen* What are you two whispering about? :yao: :malote:

**Both Principal Morys Sayko + Indys (Flashback):** NOTHING!! :loco: :yao: 🤭

-Father and son both yelled to the direction the kitchen, then looked at one another with a knowing grin.-


[5/23/2023 10:59 PM] frangipani.
-The flashback ended with the image of Indys smiling at his father... but genuinely, with his eyes smiling too.
He was smiling... at the prospect of having the opportunity to get to know the Naoris.
The camera zoomed away back into the present moment, focusing on the principal’s face which displayed his embarrassing realization that he could have known all along-

(**Principal Morys Sayko (thinking):** I should have remembered this sooner 😅 :pressf: I guess it is time to ask what I should have asked way earlier… 😅)

**Principal Morys Sayko:** 😳 I-Indys? 😅 :yaogo:

-Indys raised an eyebrow in slight confusion-

**Indys:** Yeah, dad? 🤨 Is anything the matter? 😅

**Principal Morys Sayko:** How are you feeling about Wega Academy having been chosen… instead of your school? 😅 :serio:


[5/26/2023 7:08 PM] frangipani.
-Indys stayed quiet, but his face slowly changed to a more serious expression. The principal noticed a glimmer of disappointment in his son’s eyes.-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Indys? Are you alright? 😟

-His son let out a sigh as he replied-

**Indys:** Well, first: I’m happy for you, dad. Please don’t think I would not be. :yaogo: 😅 But to be completely honest with you… it’s kind of a bummer that it wasn’t my school. 😔 I was kinda… looking forward to such an opportunity. 😅

-The principal nodded, his gaze fixating upon the newspaper on the table between him and his son.-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Hm :serio:, I can imagine that this must be difficult for you 😅, and I’m sorry that you cannot participate :serio:.

-As he lifted his gaze, he surprisingly found his son staring directly at him not in a sad, but in an intrigued way.-

**Indys:** Can’t I really, tho? 🤔 :syaogo:

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Hm? 🤨 What do you mean? 🧐

-Indys pointed at the letter from the Naori Command-

**Indys:** Could you… read out a part of that letter to me? 😅 👀 Like… the part that talks about the selection criteria for the fifteen students? 🤔

-Irritated, his father picked up the letter, searched for the paragraph about the selection of students, cleared his throat and read out:-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Ahem :idea: "For further procedure, on behalf of the Command, select 15 students of the utmost relevance, proven to possess exceptional academic, social and personal skills of precisely 5.5 TKCs or about 17 Elian years of age. Selected participants must be sharp in their cooperation and teamwork skills, in addition to a keen interest and engagement on the values of the Command. This is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of your participants to work along with the Utams." :idea:


[5/26/2023 7:14 PM] frangipani.
-He looked up from the letter, still confused-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Now 🧐 … why do you want to know? 🤔

**Indys:** Weeeell :idea: :yaonion:, since you are the one who gets to choose the fifteen participants of this project, and you’ve already been thinking about putting my friends on the list :idea:... you could also, you know… take me with you guys as well? :idea: :yaogo: I mean, the request from the Naori Command doesn’t explicitly say if the students have to be students at Wega :syaogo:. And even if that was an implicit requirement, they would not even find out that I’m not a Wega student, and neither would they probably know about this very specific - and honestly, unnecessary :yao: - law that would prohibit me from being one :idea:. What do you think, dad? Do you think you could put me on the list? :yaogo: Please? 🥺

-The principal raised his eyebrows in surprise and leaned back on his chair, making its lean creak a bit. He pondered about it for a few moments, rubbing his chin-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Hmmmm 🤔 ... what an interesting suggestion :maybe:... but there is a problem: the teachers from Wega might notice that they don’t know you 🧐

**Indys:** Well, then just take teachers from the lower grades with you :idea:. Not knowing the students from our grade would as well make the teachers less biased, so they wouldn’t treat anyone in particular unfairly whom they don’t like, which would, if that happened, shed some bad light on us in front of the Cintreans :idea: :yaogo:

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Wow, that is some smart argumentation :e_e:, but still… 😅)

**Principal Morys Sayko:** That might be feasible, but :yaogo:...


[5/26/2023 7:23 PM] frangipani.
**Indys:** C'mon, dad 🥺, it’s not prohibited to bring a student that is not from Wega, as long as they fulfill every other requirement on the list! 🥺

**Principal Indys Sayko:** I 😅... I'm sorry, son :yaogo:. I cannot make an exception for you. :serio:

**Indys:** What? 😟 But… why? 😳 😅 You are the king of making exceptions! 😅 Remember when you knowingly signed up a Deconstructor at Wega under the pretense of him being a Constructor? 🤨 You upheld that lie for an entire year! 😅

**Principal Indys Sayko:** Indeed, and I was very lucky that I was not only allowed to keep my job afterwards, but also that your mother didn’t decapitate me when she found out :e_e: :yaonion: :serio: Thus I’d risk both my job and my marriage if I allow you to participate :yaogo: :serio:

**Indys:** But mom has accepted the Naoris by now, so she wouldn’t punish us for this anymore! 😅 And you certainly won’t lose your job if you take me with you 😅 - it’s not even illegal 🥺

-Indys leaned forward and looked his father in the eyes in a stare full of desperation and determination alike-

**Indys:** And… you know I’m a decent student, not necessarily the best student, but my grades have improved a lot lately, and I've always been trying to be social and a good person 🥺. And most of all… I want to do this project! 😣 I want to get to know the Naoris! I want to talk to them, learn more about them, and maybe even befriend them! 😣 I want to experience more than the sheltered life Luria has to offer, and maybe this experience could even help me find a job! I have no idea what to do after graduation, and it’s driving me insane! 😫 So please 😣, not only do I WANT this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity… I NEED it! 🥺.


[5/26/2023 7:27 PM] frangipani.
-He pleaded, tears filling his eyes, waiting for his father to reply.
For seconds..
And for some more seconds.
Until he realized… there was no reply.
Because none was necessary.
His father just stared back at him, a sad but firm look on his face.
Indys knew what this face meant. And it told him more than words could have.-

-Indys’ face turned somber. Then he got up and murmured in a voice of genuine disappointment.-

**Indys:** So you were willing to risk your entire career for a total stranger… but you are not willing to do your own son a favor that would cost you nothing at all. :serio:

-Then he turned around and walked towards the kitchen door.-

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Wha-... 😳 :e_e: What is he implying?! 😳)

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Indys! ☝️😟

-Indys stopped in the doorframe, and turned his head around. But instead of waiting for his father to speak, he said one more thing.-

**Indys:** For the record :serio:, if you have actually read the article in the newspaper, you know that Tedu Kas Omou appears to have a daughter, Keithra. And she will participate in the project. Which makes this even more unfair. :serio:

-He finished this sentence in a dry voice, then walked out of the kitchen and went up the stairs, leaving his father alone at the kitchen table with a surprised look on his face.-

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** Wait… 😳 Tedu Kas Omou has… a daughter? :e_e: And she is going to participate?!?!?? 😱)


[5/26/2023 7:29 PM] frangipani.
-He whirled the newspaper around and read the article impatiently. His eyes went back and forth from the left to the right in an impressive speed, then he gasped and read three words out loud-

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Keithra Kas Omou… 😳 :e_e:

(**Principal Morys Sayko thinking:** He was right 😱 - I should have read the full article instead of celebrating just at the sight of the first paragraph! :derp: I need to go talk to my son! 😠 😤)

-The principal's chair trembled and nearly fell over as the principal stood up abruptly, hurried out of the room and rushed up the stairs. The camera, however, zoomed towards said article, directly towards the name: Tedu Kas Omou…-


[5/27/2023 12:49 AM] tastaturzvd
A bearded and brown haired man on a very futuristic and carefully crafted uniform, without a distinctive golden plate placed on his right arm appeared on the scene. His stance was firm but his attention was drifted, as he looked far down into the depths of space, gazing at one particular planet that anchored the orbit of a far more technologically advanced masterpiece, one worked upon for three of its years now ever since the first intervention. 

He looked puzzled, worried in a sense. His hand carefully touched his beard, generating a subtle but noticeable static, as his finger rubbed in the energy of the deflectors he and all members of his prestigious organization wore everyday until not very long ago. His visor, a device used more times that he can remember not using, warned him of someone approaching his presence. He diverted his gaze, turned around and his eyes met with a heavily armoured figure, a blond soldier that otherwise would make your shiver from top to bottom, but to him, was just an intriguing but welcomed visit.

**Woman soldier:** Master Tedu... Come to inform you, that all preparations have been completed. :sserio:

The man beams slightly, smiling to the woman, and gestured his arm inviting the woman to come into his chamber, as he seated on the chair he would normally use for receiving guests.

**Tedu Kas Omou:** That's good hear. :yaogo: Has surface sent the report to Lurian public? :sserio:

The woman nodded in affirmation.

**Tedu's apprendice:** Yes, communications in Lurian interfaces have spread the news. :sserio:

The woman walked into the room, deviating her gaze to the Naori.

**Tedu's apprendice:** Surface has also sent their regards for the effectiveness of the work. The project is going according to plan, Lurians are taking great consideration of your offer so far. :sserio:


[5/27/2023 12:51 AM] tastaturzvd
The master's grin widened as he heard such words, letting out a small chuckle: 

**Tedu Kas Omou:** Good, good. I'm positive everything will be fine. :yaogo: 

Candanz looked back at him, with an an uncomfortably neutral face. Tedu's smiling faded away as she glanced at him, then she continued:

**Tedu's apprendice:** The chosen academy is Wega, the third most relevant one in the country of Ecuia. It is appears that it is noticeable for its "talent" distribution, as well as their richness in cultural background. :sserio: People from lots of different backgrounds come to this academy. :sserio:

Tedu then raised an eyebrow, confused by her words. 

**Tedu Kas Omou:** Yes, that is correct, Lieutenant.  But... :yaogo:

The woman didn't stop there, she proceeds:

**Tedu's apprendice:** It is known for its progressive and modern curriculum, it has preceding prestige. Due to this, the Ecuian government and media has taken special notice of this investigation, headlines are popping-up left and right. This isn't just some mere news, everyone is talking about the Command. :sserio:

Tedu, seeing his apprentice is rambling, placed his elbows on the crystal clear energy table in front of him, yet with a neon colour spreading across its surface. Then he pleased his hands near his face and asked:

**Tedu Kas Omou:** What is your point in disclosing to me all of this? :serio:

The soldier narrowed her eyes, crossed her arms with flustered face.

**Tedu's apprendice:** You know what I mean. :really: Not only does your rank put weight in the relevancy of the project, but Lurians also do. I have already repeated myself before, are you sure that you want her to...?

Her master closed his eyes interrupting in annoyance, frowning his face.

**Tedu Kas Omou:** I already made my decision. She will go there. :serio:


[5/27/2023 12:52 AM] tastaturzvd
The woman twitched, visibly angered by his response.

**Tedu's apprendice:** Don't you see it? She is underqualified! 😤  Sure, she did inherit your mentorship line but, she doesn't even have your specialization! She was an exception to the rule! 😠

Tedu takes a deep breath, and with a expression that can make one feel just how much he is trying to maintain his composure, he responds: 

**Tedu Kas Omou:** I took Keit under my wing because she had potential, and because she reminded me of a dear friend of mine. 💢 She may not have received the conventional education but, she knows what she is getting into. She asked me for this. :serio:

**Tedu's apprendice:** She asked you to not leave, not to bring her along with you! 😠

**Tedu Kas Omou:** *You know I can't stay in Cintre, Candanz!!* 😠

A moment of silence between two is heard. Tedu was back at his feet again, altered by the commotion.

**Tedu Kas Omou:** I am forced to bring forth something like this. :really:

With now her name revealed to us, Candanz approached where her master stood, and placed her arm in his golden plate, looking directly at him. 

**Candanz:** Tedu, her reputation is on the line, YOUR reputation is on the line. Even the principal of Iris Academy is involved. The other students are far more qualified than her, you know your influence is what made the Utam Institute assign her to them. 😕 :really:

**Tedu Kas Omou:** She has grown much more than you believe, I have in faith in her.  :serio:

**Candanz:** I also know that she has grown. But... is it enough?  😕 

A different scene of a twin braided girl with pink-brown hair and blue eyes, surfing anxiously what seems to be the web on crystal screen appeared on scene whispering to herself while Candanz continued talking:

**Twin braided girl:** C'mon... load... 😓 

**Candanz:** Is it going to be enough for her to pass through all of this?


[5/28/2023 12:05 AM] frangipani.
Eventually, a webpage on the crystal screen appeared. It was titled “Wega Academy” in dark-blue letters on a white background. Below the title, the website displayed a photo of a large white school building that resembled a modernized fortress, below which the page showed several smaller photos with captions to click on. One caption that said, “Wega’s Weekly Highlights: A Hermarian exchange student is welcomed at Wega Academy”, featured a photo of two teachers framing two female students who were each holding a flag of their respective country and smiling at the camera. One of the two girls had short light-blond hair and was considerably shorter than the other girl who had long crimson hair. The camera zoomed on those two familiar faces and revealed them to be Undya and Marina…

The scene cut to those girls in real life, who appeared to be sitting in the back row of a bus, both in silence. Their facial expressions served as a juxtaposition to the previously seen photo: While Marina’s face looked awkward and concerned, Undya’s looked thoughtful and gloomy. The camera zoomed in on Undya looking out of the window, while Marina eyed her with a worried expression.

(**Undya thinking:** How could I allow this to happen? 😔 Should I have been more assertive? 😣 I should have…)

**Marina:** Undya? 😟

Marina’s voice softly cut through Undya’s thoughts, and brought her back to reality. 

**Undya:** H-huh? :e_e: 😓

She turned around, trying to look neutral, but the way Marina looked at her - with a face full of empathic sadness - made her eyes widen.

**Marina:** Are you okay? 😟 You’ve been so… quiet and lost in your own thoughts since breakfast 😟

Undya sighed, then slightly smiled, feeling somewhat relieved that Marina had caught on to her feelings.

**Undya:** Hehe 😅… I’m bad at hiding it, ain’t I? 🥲 

**Marina:** Your emotions are very honest :yaogo:


[5/28/2023 12:09 AM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Probably 😅. Well :yaogo: … it’s because of what happened earlier at breakfast… right before you arrived 😅 

**Marina:** Uh-huh :sserio:. What had happened? :kthinking: :sserio:

Marina asked and slightly bowed towards her friend, just enough to allow her to talk in a lower volume so that the rest of the passengers inside the bus wouldn’t hear, but still keeping enough distance so that Undya didn’t feel uncomfortable.

**Undya:** I gotta say it as it is 😅 : My parents got in an argument with my brother :sserio:, a very heated one, in fact 😅. It started when he told us about a conversation he had had with a Cintrean after his last concert, and said that this conversation had inspired him and his bandmates to play for Cintreans, and maybe even in Cintre. :sserio: My parents both hated that idea and were very… vocal about it 😅. You probably wouldn’t guess it from what you've seen of Dynlak so far, but he can be pretty hotheaded, especially when he's lacking sleep or sobering up :yaogo:. And this morning, he was doing both 😅, so you can imagine how it went :yaonion:

**Marina:** Oh, I see 😟 :sserio:. That must’ve been… tough to witness, right? 😅 :sserio:

**Undya:** Oh yeah 😅. I mean, this isn’t the first time that this has happened, by a long shot 😅 I know that at some point, they’ll reconcile, because they always do. :yaogo: Mom can’t stay mad at Dynlak for too long, so tonight she’ll probably ask me to talk to him while she talks to Dad, so that we can convince them to find a solution we can all agree on :sidea: :yaogo:. But there is another aspect of this conflict that I am worried about, tbh 😅

**Marina:** Oh, really? 😟 May I ask what it is? :yaogo:


[5/28/2023 12:12 AM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Ofc you can :yaogo: ☺️. What bothered me… was my own role inside this argument 😅 Y’know, most of the times when my parents and my brother clash, I happen to stumble upon them while they are already mid-argument, so I stay in the background because I am uninformed and can’t contribute anything :sidea: :sserio:. But this time, I was there from the start… and this time, I actually had an opinion. :yaogo:

**Marina:** Which one? 👀 Were you siding with your brother or your parents? :yaogo: :kthinking:

**Undya:** Well, at first, I was more on my parents’ side, because I agree that it would be kinda dangerous to fly to Cintre on a whim :yaonion:. But then I remembered a specific detail that my brother had mentioned :kthinking: He said that he had exchanged contact data with the Cintrean guy he had talked to, and that this guy had actually encouraged him to play in front of his fellow Cintreans :kthinking:. So that made me realize that Dynlak might have a HUGE career boost if Action Potential extends its audience in that regard :sserio:. They don’t need to fly to Cintre right away for getting famous in there if the Cintreans who could kickstart their success are already here in Ecuia :sidea: :yaogo: You see, if he just starts with small steps, instead of wanting to rush into the biggest ambition like he always does 🙄 :yaonion:, he can slowly build up a bigger fanbase and earn more money, and THEN he could prove to Mom and Dad that this was the right decision! :sidea:

**Marina:** Yeah, that sounds like a bridge between the interests of both parties :yaoc:. Did you tell them? :kthinking:


[5/28/2023 12:16 AM] frangipani.
Undya lowered her head and sighed. Marina had just hit the nail on the head.

**Undya:** I haven’t… and that’s exactly the thing that’s been bothering me. :sserio: Like, I HAD an opinion, most likely even a good one, since you agree with it too :yaogo:, but when I attempted to say something, Dad immediately shut me down and told me to stay out of it 😔. And then I didn’t say anything anymore 😅, but now, in hindsight, I wish I had. I could have perfectly solved this issue if I hadn’t been afraid of Dad yelling at me… and Mom getting mad at me as well 😖

**Marina:** Hm :kthinking: … Well, I have a theory that may relieve you from this fear :sserio:. Maybe your Dad isn’t used to you participating in the discussions he has had with your brother, and from what I have seen and heard of him, he seems to be quite… skeptical towards change :kthinking: . I bet his reaction came out of a place of fear of losing the good relationship he has with you :kthinking: :sserio:. And if he had just listened to you, he would have seen that your suggestion makes sense to everyone, so it wouldn’t have made him angry at you in the first place :yaogo:. So you don’t need to be afraid of him :sidea: :upatpat:. And same with your mom - if she can’t stay mad at your brother for long, the same would apply to you :sidea: :upatpat:.

Undya, who had listened attentively to Marina’s hypothesis, now smiled at her. Then she put her arm around Marina and hugged her.

**Undya:** Aww, Mari, you’ll be such a great therapist in the future :syaogo: :sheart: Thanks for both the explanation AND the encouragement :sidea: :sheart:


[5/28/2023 12:18 AM] frangipani.
Marina, who hugged her back, slightly blushed and replied,

**Marina:** No problem, I’m just trying my best :yaogo: :sheart:. Hope you are feeling a bit better now :sheart:

Before Undya could react, the bus came to a stop.

**Bus driver via loudspeaker:** Wega Academy. For Wega Academy, please exit here. :idea: :serio:

Undya let go of Marina and got up abruptly, grabbing her school bag.

**Undya:** Oh, we’re there. 😅 C’mon, let’s go - educational insight awaits us :yaonion:

Marina laughed and grabbed her own bag as well, then followed Undya.

The two girls left the bus, sandwiched between numerous other students who had to get out as well. 

(**Undya thinking:** Okay, Mari is behind me, so she won’t see that I'll 😅… _Block!_ 😖 😮‍💨)

Undya inhaled deeply, and imagined that she was creating a wall of stone, with a layer of wood in its middle.
A wall to block certain feelings, to keep any more Empaths from seeing that she had those in the first place.
Not only feelings of regret for past inaction, but also feelings of embarrassment towards Marina.
Because even with Marina’s emotional support, Undya was only feeling _slightly_ better than before... but not much.


[5/29/2023 12:05 AM] frangipani.
The camera panned out and showed the white, fortress-like building that had previously been established on the website of Wega Academy. This real building, however, seemed much more bubbly than its cleansed depiction on the photo. Hordes of students were either scattered across the yard, or walking towards the school’s entrance. The yard itself was decorated with green areas full of flowers and trees, as well as four benches, two to each side of the main entrance. Young people of all genders, outfit types, hair colors, and skin tones could be seen, their ages ranging from early to mid-teenagehood, many of them in groups, talking to and laughing with one another, some couples holding hands or kissing, while others were minding their own business while studying a workbook or staring into their phones.

The camera focused on one couple in particular: a chubby black-haired boy in comfy-looking clothes and a girl with glasses, a dark ponytail and a formal outfit. Sitting on the very left bench, they were apart from most of the other students. The two of them were neither holding hands nor kissing, but instead seemed to be focused on their own phones. Both were staring at and enthusiastically typing into the screens, as they were occupied with what appeared to be a mobile game. They didn’t seem to speak to one another - until something similar to an explosion was seen on both of their screens, which made the boy exclaim:

**Chubby boy:** Hah! 🤩 We did it! We won!! 🥳

 The girl victoriously raised her fist into the air:

**Girl:** YESSS!! :loco: 🥳 Get rekt, you filthy plebs! :yao: :malote: :yaonion: 

**Chubby boy:** Shhh, Sumi-chan, careful 🤫, we are at school :yao: :e_e: Don’t give people jumpscares :yao: :yaonion:


[5/29/2023 12:10 AM] frangipani.
The girl froze for a moment, then lowered her fist and looked around the yard. No one seemed to pay any attention to her. Nevertheless, she blushed, sat up straight, and whispered in a much more reserved voice:

**Sumi:** Oh 😳, I’m so sorry 😅 🙈. I got carried away by our victory 😅. You were right - this game is incredibly immersive 😅 :yaogo:

**Chubby boy:** Told ya, it makes you forget where you are :yao:! Another round before we go to class? :malote:

**Sumi:** N-no!! 😳 Ahem, I mean, I love this game 😅, but I would prefer if we could continue with it after school :yaogo: 🙈

She replied anxiously while tucking her phone into her school bag. The boy next to her chuckled and patted her hand.

**Chubby boy:** Don’t worry so much, Sumi-chan :yao::upatpat:, remember that this is the city :idea:. No one cares about whether you swear and play games on the school yard or not, ‘cuz most of us do that :yaoc:

**Sumi:** True, but not the ones that are expected to behave 😅

**Chubby boy:** Who cares? :yao: There is no reason to be ashamed of… :idea:

**Female voice:** Sakar! Sumi!

A familiar voice rang through to them and made them look up from their conversation. The camera shifted to their perspective, revealing that Undya and Marina were approaching them.

**Undya:** Good morning! 😁 😇

Undya grinned and immediately went to greet both at the same time with a hug, one arm wrapped around each one of them while they were sitting. As soon as she was done, Marina awkwardly lifted her hand as an attempt at greeting the couple, but the boy named Sakar immediately got up and pulled her in for a hug, squeezing her with his body weight.

**Marina:** Good morn- :sidea: :yaogo: -uuufffff! 😵 😮‍💨


[5/29/2023 12:12 AM] frangipani.
**Sakar:** Hey Mari! 🤗 Don’t worry, you’re allowed to hug us too :yao: :yaoc:

As he let go of Marina, Sumi stood up and deliberately hugged her in a much softer manner than her boyfriend had.

**Sumi:** Indeed, you have been around our group for two weeks now. You are one of us ☺️ :sheart:

**Marina:** Th-thanks, guys :yaogo: 🥹 :sheart:

Undya nodded in approval, then noticed that Sakar was still holding his phone, its screen displaying a “VICTORY” screen.

**Undya:** Sakar, were you just playing “Crystal Blast”? 👀 :yao: :kthinking: I hope Sumi didn’t get too bored :yaogo:

**Sakar:** Actually, we were… :idea:

**Sumi:** I-it was quite an interesting game, actually, hehe 😅 :yaogo:

Sumi interrupted her boyfriend, slightly blushing again. This made Marina look at Sumi intensely, to the point of seeing deeper than what the mere eye can see...

(**Marina thinking:** Hmmm 🤨... She _looks_ ashamed about something, but… 🧐 I can’t see any emotion inside her 😅. Either I am wrong, or Sumi is really good at blocking this emotion :yaogo: :maybe: But well, anyway, it’s probably just her being uncomfortable with lying about being interested in Sakar’s game :yaogo:)

**Male voice:** Hello there. 😌


[5/29/2023 12:14 AM] frangipani.
Another couple appeared right behind the group. It consisted of a pale girl with navy-blue hair and a navy-blue dress with black lace details, whose appearance strongly contrasted with the brown curls, orange shirt and green shorts of the boy she was holding hands with.

**Sakar:** Hello to you, Hermobi 🤭 :yao:

Undya raised her eyebrow at Sakar.

**Undya:** Really? :yao: 🧐 Thought we had settled on Nayman :kthinking: :ukawaii:

**Goth girl:** Don't settle on anything, please, both are awful shipping names :yaoc:, they sound like an evil Naori and a Lurian hero who needs to defeat him, respectively (? :yao: :ukawaii: :malote:

The others all reacted either with chuckling or with laughing, which the goth girl noticeably liked. Undya felt a sting at the mentioning of the word “Naori”, but tried her best to not let it show.

The goth girl’s boyfriend laughed the loudest as he put his arm around her.

**Goth girl’s boyfriend:** That was an excellent one, Nay 😂 :yaogo: :upatpat:

**Nayobi:** Thanks, Herman :klove: :upatpat:

**Undya:** Well, it looks like the two are happy, and that is way more important than any shipping name :syaogo: :ulike:


[5/29/2023 12:16 AM] frangipani.
Herman opened his mouth to comment on Undya’s observation, but didn’t get to, as a tall handsome boy with honey-colored hair and hazelnut-colored eyes squeezed himself right between Marina and Nayobi, touching their shoulders as he did so.

**Tall handsome boy:** Did I just hear the word… “shipping name”? :yao: :malote:

**Sakar:** Barton! :yaoc:

**Undya:** Aaaand look who appeared at the mentioning of shipping 😂 😂 :ukawaii:

The boy named Barton seemed to immediately create an invisible rift between the six students that had been there before him. While both Sakar and Undya looked happy to see him, and Sumi and Marina put on a rather neutral smile, both Nayobi and Herman seemed to be irritated by his behavior. Nayobi eyed him suspiciously and slightly moved more towards Herman, whose cold stare appeared like he wanted to get his girlfriend away from this Barton guy asap.

**Herman:** For your information, Barton, the expression “shipping name” consists of _two_ words :idea: :serio: :really:

**Barton:** Whatever, dude :yao:. So, who’s getting shipped with whom? :malote: Are Undya and Mari finally dating? (? :yao: :malote: :excelente:


[5/29/2023 12:17 AM] frangipani.
Undya rolled her eyes at Barton while Marina raised her eyebrow.

**Marina:** Well 🤨, if I was dating Undya, my boyfriend wouldn’t approve of that at all :sidea: :yao: :syaogo:

**Barton:** Your boyfriend is in Hermaria :yao:. He wouldn’t even know :yaoc: :malote:

**Marina and Herman:** :mface:

**Nayobi:** Wow :e_e:, if that’s his attitude, good thing I didn’t date _him_ long enough for us to have a long-distance phase :e_e: :yao: :yaonion:

Nayobi commented towards the other girls, not caring that Barton would be listening. Marina slowly nodded in approval.

**Barton:** Anyway :yao: If it’s not you two getting shipped, who is it then? Me? :yao: Hopefully with someone hot? :malote:


[5/30/2023 8:37 PM] frangipani.
**Sakar:** Actually, we were talking… :idea:

Sakar began to reply, while Undya glanced at him in an alarmed manner.

(**Undya thinking:** Don’t say it, Sakar, not in front of Barton… :e_e::yaonion:)

**Sakar:**... about Nayobi and Herman’s shipping names :idea:

(**Undya thinking:** :kbruh:)

Sakar finished, seemingly without bothering about potential consequences. Undya and Sumi exchanged an awkward glance.

**Barton:** Again? :yao: Damn, when Nay was still dating me, our shipping names were much prettier, but not as discussed. How unfair (? :yao: :yaonion:

He exclaimed with a mischievous expression, clearly expecting some laughs from the group, but the anticipated laughter didn’t come. The others were dead silent, and even Sakar seemed to be aware of the awkwardness of the situation. Herman looked both hurt and annoyed, and Nayobi stared at Barton with irritation in her eyes.

**Nayobi:** Dude, we’ve been over this :sderp:. No ex talk for a while, remember? :sserio:. No need to make things awkward for Herman. :ureally:


[5/30/2023 8:43 PM] frangipani.
**Herman:** This is indeed uncomfortable for me. I couldn't agree more with what _my girlfriend_ just stated :serio:

**Barton:** Eh… yeah, right, hehe 😅 :yaonion:. Sorry guys, been hanging out with Yohan and his gang last night, so I didn’t get much sleep :yaonion:. Might open my mouth before I think today :yaonion:

(**Marina thinking:** Just today? :e_e::yaonion:)

(**Undya thinking:** First Dynlak and now him? :kbruh: If even more people didn't get much sleep last night 🙄... it’s going to be a loooong school day :ureally: :sderp:)

Before Barton could continue talking about the reasons - or better said, excuses - for his lack of interpersonal boundaries, a tall girl with tanned skin, dark brown hair and light-blue eyes stepped inside their circle. Even if she had noticed the conversation topic, she didn’t seem to care, as she greeted the group with a simple and emotionless:

**Tanned girl:** ‘Sup. :sserio:

(**Undya thinking:** Oh, good that Tornoda's here 😅! Now's the chance to change topic :yaonion:)

**Undya:** Hi, Tornoda! 😁 How’s it going? 😇

**Tornoda:** Why’re you asking like that? 🤨 Did you commit a crime you’re trying to hide from me? :maybe:

She asked in a serious voice tone, like a police officer questioning a suspect in a murder case. Nayobi put her hand on Tornoda's shoulder and said with clearly joking demeanor:


[5/30/2023 8:52 PM] frangipani.
**Nayobi:** Oh, just the usual stuff. Sakar helped me with an entry on my “to kill” list, and after he’d deconstructed the guy, I helped him hide the remains, and Undya just distracted people and made sure that confrontation was avoided (?? :yao: :excelente: Right, you two? :ukawaii: :malote:

**Herman and Barton:** :e_e:

**Sumi and Marina:** :gasp:

**Sakar:** 😂 🤣 😅 

Sakar just laughed at Nayobi’s sadistic ideas. Undya, on the other hand, felt the need to respond:

**Undya:** Well, hehe 😅. Gotta do what I can do best :ukawaii: :yaonion:

(**Undya thinking:** Yeah… I'm good at... "avoiding" 😅 😓)

Tornoda cracked a slight smile.

**Tornoda:** Hm. 😌 Wasn’t expecting anything less from you guys. :yaogo:

She murmured, then took out her phone and unlocked its screen. In the meantime, the other characters started to have their own conversations in smaller circles. Barton started talking to Sakar and Sumi, and Nayobi whispered something to Herman, as Marina asked Undya a question:

**Marina:** First class today is gonna be Hermarian, right? :kthinking: I still can’t remember the curriculum for Ciranday 😅

**Undya:** Nope, Hermarian’s the first class on Suranday :syaogo:. Your confusion’s not your fault tho, I should differ a bit more in my pronunciation of those two days :yaogo:. Today’s first class is Science in your case and Informatic Science in mine, followed by Ecuian Studies. :sidea: Then there's Global Ed, and then we'll be finished off with Math 😵‍💫 :yaonion:


[5/30/2023 8:55 PM] frangipani.
**Marina:** Ah okay, I see :syaogo:. So we’ll have most classes together :ulike:

Undya nodded, then started talking to Marina about last week’s classes of Ecuian Studies. Meanwhile Barton and Sakar were discussing strategies for the game “Crystal Blast”, while Sumi stood there awkwardly, as if she wanted to comment on the boys' strategies but didn’t have the guts to. Nayobi and Herman shared a kiss, then looked at one another as if there was no one else around them. Tornoda, who was still on her phone, suddenly stopped scrolling. Her eyes and mouth opened wide, and for the first time since her introduction, she was showing some emotion.

The camera cut to her phone screen. It was an online version of the same article that the principal and his son had talked about, the one with the following headline: “WEGA ACADEMY CHOSEN FOR NEW PROJECT WITH THE NAORI COMMAND”.

Tornoda turned towards Nayobi and Herman with the intention of disrupting their seemingly romantic couple's conversation:

**Tornoda:** Guys!! 😲 You won’t believe what-

The school bell rang - and managed to disrupt everyone’s conversation.

**Undya:** Oh - the bell! 👀

**Marina:** Let’s go then! :syaogo::yaonion:

**Herman:** It is time to go to our respective classrooms :idea:. We shall keep conversing during recess :idea: :yaogo:

**Tornoda:** …sure. :really:

She murmured with a frown, then followed the rest of the gang who were already walking towards the school entrance together, only for most of them to split up for their respective classes afterwards.


[6/3/2023 6:15 PM] frangipani.
During Informatic Science, Undya didn’t participate much in class. Instead she mostly focused on listening to the teacher and replicating what she taught them on the computer. After sixty minutes, the bell finished the class, giving the students ten minutes to head from one classroom to another.

Sakar, who was sitting to Undya's right and Sumi's left, stretched out his arms:

**Sakar:** Ahh :yaoc: That was tiring 🥱 :yaonion:

Undya replied while saving her progress on the school laptop in front of her:

**Undya:** I agree :yaonion: The only one who didn't look overwhelmed by today's lesson was Sumi :ukawaii:… am I right? 😉

**Sumi:** Well 😅, I found today's topic very interesting :sidea: :yaogo:

Sumi replied with a blush, then got up from her seat. Undya and Sakar stood up a moment later as well.

**Sakar:** And you're very good at it too :idea: Pretty sure you know more about computers and technology than Herman does :yaoc:

**Sumi:** I am not sure about that, hehe 😅 ☺️ Anyway, we’ve got classroom preparation duty today. :sidea: So I guess we need to go to the next class soon, darling. :yaogo:

**Sakar:** Our prep’s today? 😳 Damn, I would have totally forgotten about it 😅 :yaonion:

**Undya:** Good thing you have Sumi :syaogo: 😉. Well, then I won’t stop you and give Mr. Restor a reason to hate ya :syaogo: :ukawaii: Good luck, and see you guys after Ecui! 😉 👋 

**Sakar and Sumi:** See ya! 😁 👋

They waved to one another, then Sumi and Sakar went off to the opposite direction as Undya.


[6/3/2023 10:55 PM] frangipani.
A few moments later, Undya arrived at the classroom where Ecuian Studies would start in a few more minutes. Only a couple of students were occupying their seats, one of which being Herman. He was studying his notebook and casually munching on what looked like a sweet snack. Undya walked up to him and, as soon as they made eye contact, greeted him with familiar words:

**Undya:** Hello there! :ukawaii: :syaoc:

Herman lifted his hand to greet her back, then swallowed the sweet he was chewing on before he replied.

**Herman:** Nice reference. :yaoc:

**Undya:** What? 😆 I like that greeting, it's very… "you" :syaogo:.

Undya replied, then swung herself onto the empty chair next to him.

**Undya:** How's it going? :syaogo: Prepared for Ecui? :ukawaii:

She asked and pointed at the notebook, which appeared to be full of long sentences written with surprisingly neat handwriting. Herman nodded.

**Herman:** I know each page from the last few lessons by heart :yaoc:.

**Undya:** I knew it 😁 Meanwhile, I am feeling like I remember nothing at all 😅. I sometimes wish one could have more than one Talent :yaonion:

Herman lifted his head and tilted it slightly, with an intrigued and thoughtful look on his face.


[6/3/2023 10:58 PM] frangipani.
**Herman:** I agree that it would be an interesting experience to have not one, but two different Talents :idea: 🤔 Such possibility would imply a vast array of implications, both personal and societal :maybe:. I wonder if I shall ask Mrs. Hamor about this possibility in today's class 🤔

**Undya:** O-okay, sure, why not :yaogo: A-anyway, how's it going with Nay? You guys seemed happy this morning :syaogo:

Herman's face softened, and he smiled with absent-minded eyes.

**Herman:** We were indeed happy this morning, and we still are ☺️ 🥰 

**Undya:** I'm glad to hear that ☺️ :ulike: Soon you'll be together for one month, right? 👀

**Herman:** Indeed, on Suranday this will be the case :yaoc: In order to celebrate, I am planning to escort her to her favorite picnic spot after school :idea:

**Undya:** Aww, really? 😲 That is sooo romantic :klove:! I am sure she's going to love it! 😁

**Herman:** I am hoping your certainty will prevail 😌. Speaking of this topic, I do have one request for you though. :serio:

**Undya:** Huh? :e_e: What is it? 😳

Herman's eyes darted back and forth, scanning the entire room for a familiar face. Then he looked Undya in the eyes with a determined and serious stare, and said, with a lowered voice:

**Herman:** Please do not tell Barton. :serio:

Undya slowly nodded while raising an eyebrow.

**Undya:** Sure :kthinking:, but may I ask why? 🤨

Herman frowned.

**Herman:** Because of his tendency to… comment on our relationship. :serio: Many of the things he says about Nay, me, or both or us, are rather… uncalled for 😒.


[6/3/2023 11:57 PM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Like the thing he said this morning? :e_e: Yeah, that was… not very well-thought from his part 😅

**Herman:** That is an understatement, but I am glad you seem to agree :serio:

Undya nodded again, this time noticeably quicker.

**Undya:** Uh-huh 😅 Yup, I do :yaogo: Don’t worry, I won’t tell him ☺️

(**Undya thinking:** Neither about his plan nor about me agreeing with Herman’s opinion 😅 :yaonion:.)

**Herman:** Good. :serio: … Oh - there he is :serio:.

Just as Herman commented, barking laughter could be heard from the entrance of the classroom. As Undya turned, she saw Barton arrive, together with two tall, thin and tanned guys who clearly were identical twins, a dark-skinned girl with colorful clothes and a short guy with glasses and wavy light-blond hair. Both Barton and the girl appeared to be laughing their asses off at whatever one of the twins had just shown them on their phone.

**Barton:** 😂 😂 😂 Dude, you gotta send me that! :syaogo: :yaonion:

As the group entered the classroom, they immediately went to their seats in the last row and sat down next to a girl with long blond hair and heavy make-up who noticed their arrival but tried to ignore them.


[6/3/2023 11:58 PM] frangipani.
When Undya’s eyes met Barton’s, she lifted her hand to greet him in a similar manner to how Herman had greeted her earlier. Barton smiled widely and shouted over the two half-empty rows that separated them:

**Barton:** Hey guys! :yaoc: Wanna see something hilarious? :yao: 😂 :yaonion: Yohan, show them! 😂 :yaonion:

The twin next to him grinned and unlocked his phone’s screen. As he held his phone towards Undya and Herman, they saw what appeared to be a short video from a social media platform:


[6/8/2023 10:13 PM] tastaturzvd
The video presented a frenzied pace, with rapid scene transitions that make it difficult to fully grasp the content completely. The video spanned around 2 to 3 minutes in duration, and immediately as it started, the video narrator posed a pending question to the audience:

**Video narrator:**  DO YOU FEEL LONELY!? :idea:

*Background video:* A video clip of rain falling appeared.

**Video narrator:** DO NO BODY LOVE YOU BECUASE YOU ARE A SORE LITTLE LOSER CRYING IN THE CORNER!? :yao: 

*Background video:* A person sobbing in a corner was shown.

**Video narrator:** DO YOU WANT TO GET *THAT* HOT CINTREAN PATROLLING AROUND IN YOUR LOCAL CITY?? :malote: :he:

*Background video:* A random girl dresses like a Naori agent popped up.

Then the presenter appeared,  and making a thumbs up, winking at the camera with a big smile, declared:

**Video narrator:** "DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER, BECAUSE *I* HAVE JUST THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR YOU!!" :idea: :malote:

**Video narrator:** USE THE NEXT 5 LOOPHOLES IN CINTREAN SOCIETY THAT WILL GARANTEE YOU SOME NICE QUALITY SLEEP WITH A NAORI CHICK!! :he: IT IS. THAT. SIMPLE!! :malote: 

*Background video:* Switched to an scene of various model posing as cintreans on the street.


[6/8/2023 10:14 PM] tastaturzvd
**Video narrator:** STEP 1: BE CAREFUL!! CHECK THEIR TECHNOLOGY!! :tf: 

*Background video:* A video of an actress portraying a Fort soldier nearby an known university

**Video narrator:** CINTREANS WILL HAVE SLIGHTLY GLOWING EYES WHENEVER THEY ARE USING THEIR CRYSTALLINE TECH :e_e:, IF YOU NOTICE ONE, GO AWAY!! :yaonion:

*Background video:* As the camera zoomed in on the actress, a slight blue hue appeared on her eyes.  The same video guy approached her in the scene, but then backs out of the frame awkwardly as soon as he attempted to greet her. The actress acted confused upon the encounter.

**Video narrator:** YOU WILL NOT WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THEM. Believe me, they ARE scary. :e_e:

*Background video:* The video guy runs away freaked out as some bad quality CGI attempted to portray explosions, as if he was being attacked by the "cintrean".

**Video narrator:** STEP 2: GET THEIR CODE!! :idea:

*Background video:* The same girl seemed to have a normal conversation with the guy.

**Video narrator:** CINTREANS ARE FORCED BY LAW TO GIVE AWAY THEIR GREAT LINK ID IF YOU ASK FOR IT. :idea:

*Background video:* Showed some shiny numbers coming out from the narrator.

**Video narrator:** PAY ATTENTION TO IT, IT MIGHT BE USEFUL LATER! :idea:

**Video narrator:** STEP 3: USE YOUR KNOWLEDGE!! :he:

*Background video:* The head of the guy appeared artificially enlarged by some video editing software.

**Video narrator:**  GET THEM INTERESTED IN YOU BY TELLING THEM EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR PLANET. :idea:


[6/8/2023 10:14 PM] tastaturzvd
*Background video:* The actress and the video guy talked around in a restaurant. The girl still wore her "Fort armor" in a comically unrealistic contrast with the rest of the people around.

**Video narrator:** USE THE CODE THEY MENTIONED EARLIER TO SEARCH INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND THEN JUST GIVE THEM INSIGHT IN EVERYTHING THEY SEEM THEY ARE INTERESTED IN. THEY'LL LOVE THAT.  :he:

*Background video:* The video guy types frantically and overexcitedly on the keyboard of a computer.

**Video narrator:** STEP 4: TAKE THEM HOME!! :idea:

The video goes back to the video guy in his room.

**Video narrator:** Wait wait wait Mark, is it really that simple!? :gasp: 

The narrator acted as if he were in disbelief.

**Video narrator:** **YES, IT IS**. :he: JUST EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW NORMAL AND EXPECTED IT IS FOR YOU TO TAKE YOUR DATES TO YOUR HOME AS A FROM OF HOSPITALITY.  :idea:

**Video narrator:** Believe me or not, THEY'LL FALL FOR IT!! :excelente:

**Video narrator:** And last and most important step: SLEEP WITH THEM!! :he:

*Background video:* An silhouetted scene of two people about to go do their "duties" on the bed in slow motion appeared with a few seconds of sexy music.

**Video narrator:** HOW!? :e_e: You may ask. WELL... CINTREANS ARE SECRETLY HORNY AS *beeping sound* - How do I know? BECAUCE SCIENCE. :he:

*Background video:* A nerdy look with some glasses and a chemistry glassware appeared comically added onto him, along with some bubbling noises.

**Video narrator:** CINTREAN RELATIONSHIPS WORK DIFFERENTLY FROM OUR WORLD! :yaonion: THEY DO NOT NEED ENGAGEMENT. 🥱 

*Background video:* A X sign along with an error sound effect appeared on top of a picture of someone proposing marriage to another person.


[6/8/2023 10:14 PM] tastaturzvd
**Video narrator:** THEY DON'T NEED FANCY FLOWERS NOR CHOCOLATES. 🙄 

*Background video:*  The same sound and sign showed up  now in photo e of a person giving chocolates to another one.

**Video narrator:** IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF YOU, OR THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THEMSELVES! :he:

*Background video:* And finally, a photo of two people kissing suffered the same fate.

**Video narrator:** Why!? THEY ARE ALL ABOUT BUSINESS!!  🤑 💵 

*Background video:* *STONKS*

**Video narrator:**  TELL THEM THAT YOU ARE DOING RESERACH ON HOW CINTREAN SEX COMPARES TO OURS, AND THEY'LL MOST LIKELY ACCEPT!! 😏 

*Background video:* The same captivating erotic music intensified until the point of oversaturating the audio. Two people go to bed in an scene which frames crazily shaked as the 
music distorted. 

**Video narrator:** AND THAT'S IT! :malote: FOLLOW THESE 5 STEPS, AND YOU WILL NEVER CRY IN THE CORNER FOREVER ALONE AGAIN. :idea: 

*Background video:* Yay sound noises.

 **Video narrator:**  LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE IF-


[6/9/2023 12:20 AM] frangipani.
As soon as Yohan stopped the video, Barton burst out in laughter again:

**Barton:** HAHAHAHA 😂 😂 :yao: Hilarious, right? :yao: Who needs Seduction class if all you need to do is ask a Cintrean if they wanna fuck? 😂 :yaonion:

**Yohan:** Ikr 😂 😂 :yaonion:

He replied, then switched off his phone's screen. Undya cackled awkwardly in response.

**Undya:** Yeah, hehehe 😅, that was certainly… something :yaonion:

(**Undya thinking:** That was… weird 😅 Can it really be that simple to hook up with a Cintrean? :e_e: I highly doubt it, it's probably clickbait :yaogo:. But I'd better not ruin Barton's amusement :yaonion: 😅)

While Barton and Yohan were laughing, and Undya tried to keep up an amused appearance, Herman was not even cracking a smile.

**Herman:** Incredible how much rubbish is taught on social media. :really:

His harsh reaction startled the other three.

**Yohan:** What? 😳

**Barton:** Huh? What do you mean? 🤨

**Undya:** :e_e:

**Herman:** I mean some uninformed person spreading lies about the Cintreans and giving advice on how to manipulate them :really:

**Barton:** Hey, that's not true! :yao: This guy's a Seeker, so he's gotta know! :yaoc:

**Herman:** You seem to be unaware that it is not mandatory for Knowledge Seekers to speak the truth. :really: As a matter of fact, Seekers can use their Talent as an excuse to suggest credibility when there, actually, is not any :idea:. This Seeker-related Halo Effect is quite common and has occurred many times in history :idea: :serio:.


[6/9/2023 12:24 AM] frangipani.
Herman explained and stared at Barton with a serious face. The latter, then, suppressed a chuckle, as he replied:

**Barton:** Dude, don’t give me a history lesson :yao: :yaonion: Also, how much do YOU know about Cintrean relationships? :yao: You never know, maybe the Cintreans are actually trying to manipulate US into thinking they don’t want anything from us, by acting all formal and stuff, but then, once you get to know them, they'd be more than ready to fuck you :yaonion: :he:. Maybe they are just huge pervs in disguise :he: :malote: In this case, it would even be smart of us to "manipulate" them first, so that we stay in control :idea: :malote:

**Herman:** First off, are you hearing yourself? Manipulation for a selfish purpose equals smartness? :really: Only a Seducer would say this :mface: And second… :idea:

Barton interrupted Herman with an agitated voice.

**Barton:** Hey man, we don't manipulate people! :yao: We only bring out the tendencies that are already inside them :he: :malote:

Herman rolled his eyes and sighed, but tried his best to keep a calm tone in his voice.


[6/11/2023 10:00 PM] frangipani.
Herman: 🙄 What a blatantly euphemistic statement :really: Anyway, I am deeply convinced I know significantly more about Cintrean dating than you do. :idea: First off, Cintreans are much more focused on their work than Ecuians are, which implies a certain degree of formality throughout :idea:. Being professional is a key aspect of Cintrean culture and even ties into Cintreans' private lives. Even friendships are mostly formed with the intent of working together, not necessarily with the purpose of spending time with one another in their private lives, which are basically non-existent due to Cintrean work-life standards :idea:. This extends to romantic relationships as well - even though their bonds are not as “romantic” as in our culture, they tend to be very strong regardless :idea:. Romanticism is very different in Cintre, and even their perception of sexual activity is different: Sex used to be a taboo in the Cintreans’ past, but nowadays sex is seen as a natural human need, thus Cintreans are open towards sex with most people, as their technology filters out potential sexual partners that could be related by blood to prevent any accidental incest :idea:.

(**Undya thinking:** Wow, he really knows quite a lot :e_e: :ulike:)

Barton, who had looked bored throughout most of Herman’s speech, suddenly sat up straighter as Herman explained the Cintreans’ sex lives.

**Barton:** Wait, are you saying 😳 … that the Cintreans would fuck anyone as long as they’re not family? :he:

**Herman:** Precisely, if they feel the need to do so, not out of blind horniness :serio:. I hope now, with this information, you perceive me as trustworthy in regards to knowledge about Cintreans :really:.


[6/11/2023 11:39 PM] frangipani.
**Barton:** Even if they are in a relationship? :e_e: :malote:

Herman frowned and inhaled deeply, but stayed quiet for a few seconds, as he appeared to be thinking.

**Herman:** Hmm… 🤔 To be frank with you :serio:... I am not quite sure about this aspect 😅

Barton apparently ignored the doubt in Herman’s words, and looked first at Undya, then at Yohan, with a face of joyful anticipation.

**Barton:** That could mean, if I am lucky enough to meet a Cintrean :he:, there is a chance that I could hook up with them, even if they are in a relationship :malote:.

Undya noticed how Herman’s frown seemed to deepen and become more serious, more somber.

**Herman:** Would you do so? :really: As far as I know, those that are taken are out of the question for dating… or are they not? :serio:

**Barton:** Well, on Luria maybe :yaoc:. People here are sooo uptight when it comes to relationships :yao:. Maybe Cintreans are more progressive when it comes to relationships too :malote: :yaonion:

**Herman:** Progressive…?! 🤨 Did you just call cheating on one's partner “progressive”? 🧐


[6/11/2023 11:39 PM] frangipani.
Herman responded, in such a petrified manner that even Barton seemed to catch on to it. Yohan, in the meantime, had stopped following the conversation altogether and now looked at his phone, seemingly watching another video.

**Barton:** Whoa, wait, buddy, I never said such a thing! :yao: I mean, it's not cheating if both partners are cool with it, right? :yaonion: And that attitude of being cool with a casual adventure outside of your relationship, without the consequence of your relationship being in shambles afterwards, THAT is what I call progressive :idea: :malote:


[6/12/2023 10:54 PM] frangipani.
Barton explained, hoping to smooth the waves of arising conflict, only to achieve the opposite. Herman stared at him with grim eyes, visibly triggered but trying to pull himself together.

**Herman:** I believe the progressiveness of casual sex with a person other than your partner to be entirely subjective :serio: :really:. While it is true that every couple can set individual rules for their relationship, no intrinsic value can be applied to those decisions :idea: :serio:. Whether they are seeing, flirting with, kissing or fornicating other people aside from their partner, or not doing any of those, it is alright, as long as both partners agree. :idea: :serio:

In response, Barton, who had listened with a somewhat serious expression, let out a chuckle.

**Barton:** Heh. :yaogo:. Relax, man, no need to make a big deal out of this :yaoc: Especially if it isn’t a big deal to me :yao: :yaonion:

**Herman:** Well, it should be. :serio: :really:. You should respect other people’s relationships, regardless of the rules and boundaries of someone’s relationships being known or unknown to you :really:.

Barton stayed quiet for a few seconds, as if he was pondering Herman's words. Then, an expression of clarity appeared on his face.

**Barton:** Wait a minute :e_e:... I know what’s going on :yao: :maybe:. This is not about the Cintreans, is it? :maybe: It’s about Nay! :idea:

**Herman:** Do not bring Nay into this!! 😠

Herman reacted with an angered, elevated voice which made Undya flinch.

(**Undya thinking:** Oh no 😟, he clearly hit the spot 😅 :e_e:)


[6/12/2023 10:58 PM] frangipani.
Barton raised his eyebrows at the infuriated Herman.

**Barton:** Dude, don’t freak out :e_e: :yao:, I don’t have any intention to steal her from you :yaogo:. Yeah, I’ve dated her before, yada yada yada :yao:, but she broke up with me, duh :yao: :pressf:. So she clearly doesn’t want anything from me, she only wants you, man, so why bother? :yao: It’s been over for eons, so no need to be jealous :yaonion:

**Herman:** If it’s been over for eons :really: … Then why do you still bring it up all the time? :mface: :serio:

**Barton:** I don’t bring it up THAT often :yao:

(**Undya thinking:** He does :e_e: 🙄)

**Herman:** You do. :serio: It is rude and disrespectful towards both Nay and me. :serio: Thus I am hereby asking you... to stop. Bringing. It. Up. :serio:

He asked, each syllable coming out of his mouth sounding raw and dry.

(**Undya thinking:** Oh damn :o_O: I haven’t seen him this serious in a long time… :e_e: I knew Barton’s references were uncomfortable to him, especially the one from earlier today… 😅)

A flashback to the gang’s conversation from earlier appeared inside Undya’s mind:

**Barton (Flashback):** Again? :yao: Damn, when Nay was still dating me, our shipping names were much prettier, but not that discussed. How unfair (? :yao: :yaonion:

This time, the camera focused on Herman’s face while Barton’s words could be heard in the background. A sting of jealousy was visible in Herman’s face, and a spark of repressed anger glimmered in his envy-green eyes.


[6/12/2023 10:59 PM] frangipani.
Then, the camera switched back to the present, showing Herman’s face again - this time, the sensation of jealousy was visible all over his entire face, and the spark of anger inside his eyes had turned into a wildfire. While the camera kept holding onto his expression, Undya’s thoughts narrated over it:

(**Undya thinking:** …but I didn’t know it would make him _this_ upset :e_e: :gasp:)


[6/12/2023 11:28 PM] frangipani.
For a few seconds, Barton’s jaw looked like it was about to drop in surprise upon hearing Herman’s words. However, his face suddenly lost all its relaxed playfulness, and turned into a tense, intimidating frown instead.

**Barton:** Dude :really:… are you serious? 😡 Are you trying to censor me, to prohibit me from speaking my mind?! 😠 🤬 

His words came out of his throat like a growl, and he leaned forward on his desk and stared Herman directly in the eyes, returning his bold gaze with defiant determination. Undya inhaled sharply, but the guys did not pay any attention towards her.

(**Undya thinking:** Oh fuck :o_O: He’s triggered one of Barton’s weak spots :e_e:... his desire for free speech 😳 :gasp:)

**Herman:** I am not trying to censor you :really:, I am asking you to be more respectful towards my boundaries…

**Barton:** But that IS censoring me!! :loco: 😠 I mean, dude, I totally get that me being your girl’s ex must suck for you :yao:, but you gotta get over it! :derp: You cannot tell me to be quiet about things that have happened in the past, because, welp, it’s the past, dummy :yao::derp:, it has already happened, so you can’t do anything about it anyway :yao: :really:

**Herman:** I can accept the past, but I cannot accept you rubbing unnecessary details and implications in my face every day! 😠 That is just unreasonably childish, rude and disrespectful, both towards Nay as your ex and me as her new boyfriend! 😠 It is unfortunate we are all in the same friend circle, but you cannot force us to leave it just because you refuse to control your own emotions! 😤 😡


[6/12/2023 11:53 PM] frangipani.
**Barton:** _I_ refuse to control my emotions??? Hah!:yao: 🤣 What’s the reason you’ve brought this up in the first place, huh? :yaogo: :really: Emotions, what else! :yao: Don’t be so hypochondrical! :yaonion: :derp:

**Herman:** It’s called “hypocritical”, you fool! 😠 :kbruh: And you are being no less hypocritical according to your own logic, because you are clearly not using the rational side of your brain either! 😤 😡

Both of the guys were at the edge of their own seats, filling the atmosphere with resentment… and attracting more and more attention from their peers. Thus, the spiteful presence of the two boys seemed to gradually fill the room, while Undya felt like she was shrinking on her chair… and wished she actually could.

(**Undya thinking:** Oh no, no, no no no :o_O:... Herman’s getting more and more triggered by the minute, and Barton’s… like a completely different person :loco: And worst of all... both of them have some valid points! :e_e: This is a disaster! 😖)


[6/14/2023 10:48 PM] frangipani.
Inside this disaster, Barton didn’t seem to have any intention to stop.

**Barton:** Well, I DO think it is rational to keep up the right for free speech, and to not censor it just because some words might hurt you! :really: Like jeez, dude, grow up! :derp:

**Herman:** YOU are the one who needs to grow up, and finally apprehend that we live in a society with rules of etiquette, which all of us need to adapt to, and this also includes Seducers and, more specifically, you :really:. If every person around us opened their mouth before using their brain, the comfortable societal structures you adore so much would cease to exist in the blink of an eye! :mface:

**Yohan:** Ahem, Herman? :yaogo:

Yohan’s voice unexpectedly interrupted the two arguing boys, taking both of them by surprise.

**Herman:** What is it? :really: :serio:

**Yohan:** I hate to interrupt you two, but this argument is pointless :yaogo:.

(**Undya thinking:** Phew, he's ending the discussion 😅. Thanks, Yohan :yaonion:)

**Yohan:** Because Barton is right: you cannot prohibit someone else from saying whatever they want. Sorry, dude, but you know we live in a democracy 😅.

He explained towards Herman with a careful, yet unshaken voice. Barton gave Yohan a slight relieved smile.

**Barton:** Thanks, man 😮‍💨 :yaogo:

(**Undya thinking:** Aw no 😢, this didn't settle the debate at all - he got involved as well instead! 😖)


[6/15/2023 12:09 AM] frangipani.
Herman wasn’t having any of this.

**Herman:** I agree that arguing with me about free speech would be pointless, since you two should know me well enough to know I oppose neither democracy nor free speech :really: :derp:. What I oppose is Barton’s lack of a verbal filter, which ruins the atmosphere of every conversation, or better said, emotional stupidity. :mface:

Someone in the classroom loudly said “ooof”, to which Undya could relate.

(**Undya thinking:** Here we go again :kbruh: 🙄)

**Yohan:** But that’s not true! :yao: I for a fact don't feel harassed by people pointing out that Ovana is my ex :idea:...

He defended himself, and pointed at the dark-skinned girl in colorful clothing that was sitting in the same row as them. At the mention of her name, she immediately dropped the women’s magazine she was reading, and gave Yohan a shocked face.

**Ovana:** Whoa, hold on a minute 😅 😳, _you_ may not have felt harassed, but I did! 🤨 It was so rude how everyone always talked about us as a couple even after our breakup, I HATED that :e_e: 😡.

She responded quickly and with a fervor that surprised Undya.

(**Undya thinking:** She rarely reacts this harshly :e_e:... so that must have _really_ ticked her off :yaonion:. Good thing I haven’t asked her much about it lately 😅)


[6/15/2023 12:11 AM] frangipani.
**Herman:** You see? :really: I am not the only one who understands this situation :serio:

**Ovana:** Uh-huh :yaogo: :ureally:

**Yohan:** Really? :e_e: Oh damn, I didn’t know :yaonion:

**???**: Indeed you didn’t. :serio: But that doesn’t matter, since you and Barton are in the right anyways. :really:

Another voice joined the discussion. It came from the boy with very light blond hair and glasses, who had a similar appearance to Herman, but a very different, much more abrasive and impatient aura. Herman didn’t seem to approve of his involvement.

**Herman:** Mihayl, you know, it is quite impolite to randomly check people’s knowledge while they are distracted :really:.

Mihayl gave him an unamused glance.

**Mihayl:** And YOU know it’s “quite impolite” to try to tell people to shut up with polite words, don’t you?! 😒 :mface:

Herman just rolled his eyes, but didn’t reply, his body language showing that he did not want to talk to this boy any further.

**Barton:** Well, I guess, most of us are on my side :yaoc:

Barton said triumphantly and gestured towards the people sitting next to him, but Yohan’s twin looked at him skeptically and shook his head.

**Barton:** Whaaat? :gasp: C’mon, Yorin :yaogo: I know you wanna be different from your brother, but not like that :yao: :yaonion:

**Yorin:** I actually side with Herman tho 😅. I believe he deserves closure instead of being reminded of his girlfriend’s previous relationship all the time :idea: :yaogo:

He elaborated, while his twin brother looked at him somewhat disappointedly.


[6/15/2023 12:14 AM] frangipani.
The blond girl at the end of their row of seats finally turned around, which made Undya, who was still just watching the conflict, anticipate even worse outcomes for this discussion.

(**Undya thinking:** Oh no, if Ilya gets involved too, hell will break loose in this class :e_e:. She has a tendency to draw a lot of attention if she wants to 🙄)

Indeed, the girl named Ilya signalized her annoyance quite clearly:

**Ilya:** Could you guys please shut up? :loco: 😒 I still need to do my homework for this class, I didn’t ask for a fucking debate right next to me 😑 🤬

**Barton:** As if you cared that much about homework :yao: :derp:

**Yohan:** Whose side are you on? 👀 You MUST have an opinion on this if you overheard it :idea:

Yohan asked Ilya, who scoffed before she replied.

**Ilya:** Well, Barton’s, obvi! I’m not a pussy like... others 🙄

She said, gesticulating towards Ovana and Yorin.

**Barton:** Ha!! :yao: :malote: Guess I’ll take back what I said about you and homework 😁


[6/15/2023 12:15 AM] frangipani.
However, this discussion was far from over. Several more classmates started to communicate their own opinions, and the discussion extended to the entirety of the students inside the classroom. For several minutes, students all around Undya were discussing back and forth, about whether Barton or Herman was right, whether free speech could be impacted by emotions, and so on. Undya, though, still didn’t know whose side she was on.

(**Undya thinking:** I don't even know what to think... after all, I understand both of their perspectives 😅 Herman doesn’t want to be reminded of his girlfriend’s ex all the time, but Barton doesn’t want to censor himself and wants to feel free in his choice of words :kthinking: Both of their perspectives are valid! 😖 Ahhh! I don’t want to side with just one of them :sderp:. Where’s Mrs. Hamor? Can't class finally start?! 😩)

But instead of the teacher, a short, ginger-haired girl from the first seating row approached the whiteboard. She grabbed a whiteboard pencil from the teacher’s desk, took off its cap, and drew a line on the whiteboard, which made a loud, painful screeching sound. Her classmates wailed in discomfort and covered their ears.


[6/15/2023 12:17 AM] frangipani.
**Several students:** AHHH!!! :loco: 😖 

**Undya:** AHHH!!! 😫

**Ilya:** Agh 😖! WAYRA, WHAT THE FUCK?!?! :loco: :sderp: :mface:

The ginger girl, Wayra, just smiled confidently.

**Wayra:** My dear fellow students, this discussion is very interesting, but has gone long enough without any productive outcome aside from absolute and utter chaos :yaoc:, and I cannot write chaos into my weekly report for the school newspaper :sidea: :yaonion:

(**Undya thinking:** This girl takes her newspaper duties too seriously sometimes :e_e: 😑, but she is right, it’s time for this discussion to end 😅)

**Barton:** You’re on my side tho, aren’t cha? :yao: :malote:

Barton yelled from the back of the room, surrounded by classmates that were siding with him.

(**Undya thinking:** Orrrr maybe not 🙄)

**Wayra:** I’m on Herman’s side :sidea:, but I think we should settle this once and for all, by voting :sidea:. We are 29 students, and everyone’s here by now, so there MUST be a majority :sidea:. THEN you guys will get closure, and I’ll get to write an article about this debate, proving that our school has a mature way of dealing with discrepancies between students :sidea: :yaoc:


[6/15/2023 6:49 PM] frangipani.
The other students started to murmur, most of them seemed to approve of Wayra's idea. Undya didn’t.

(**Undya thinking:** What? 😳 No! :e_e: 😰)

**Wayra:** So, you guys? :yaoc: Wanna settle this once and for all? 😁

She asked the two boys who had started the discussion in the first place. Barton shrugged, and Herman nodded.

**Barton:** Yeah, whatever :yao:. I already know I'm gonna win anyway :yaonion:

**Herman:** Let’s do it to decide about the general consensus of this class. :serio: As you can see, Yohan, I do, in fact, care about democracy. :really: :serio:

Wayra grinned and wrote both of their names on the whiteboard. Then she turned around and asked loudly:

**Wayra:** Alright, who is in favor of Barton? Raise your hand! :sidea: One hand per person, please :ureally:


[6/15/2023 6:52 PM] frangipani.
**Barton:** Aw maaan :yao: :yaonion:

Barton replied and put down one of his hands. A lot of students around him and Undya had raised their hands. Undya hadn't.

(**Undya thinking:** I'm gonna stay neutral and refuse to vote :yaogo: Hope I won't be the only one tho 😅)

Wayra quickly counted the raised hands, simultaneously checking if Barton's friends were trying to use the same cheat Barton had just tried to use, which luckily didn't happen again.

**Wayra:** -*whispering*- …twelve, thirteen, fourteen :sidea: :yaoc: -*at regular volume*- Looks like you guys might be the slightly smaller minority in this debate :yaoc:

She commented while writing down the number 14 next to Barton's name. Undya inaudibly sighed in relief.

**Barton:** Can we see how many people'd vote for Herman too tho? :idea: :maybe: Maybe we are less than 29 in class today, and you just counted incorrectly :yao:

Wayra raised an eyebrow at Barton's suggestion.

**Wayra:** I know how to count 🤨, but sure, for the sake of fairness :sidea: So, ladies and gents in favor of Herman, please raise your hands now! :sidea: :yaoc:

She exclaimed with enthusiasm and raised her own hand along with many of her classmates. Undya, again, didn't raise her own hand.

(**Undya thinking:** Fingers crossed that no one will notice 😅 :yaonion:)


[6/15/2023 7:41 PM] frangipani.
While Undya was worrying, Wayra finished counting - and came to a surprising conclusion.

**Wayra:** …eleven, twelve, thirteen :sidea:... fourteen? 😳 :kthinking: That means, it's a tie! 😲

Some students gasped and started to whisper with one another. Undya felt a shiver running down her spine, as if she had just been caught in a lie.

(**Undya thinking:** Fuck 😳 😰 :gasp:)

**Yohan:** A tie? How could that be? :e_e:

**Barton:** Phew 😮‍💨, told ya I wouldn't have the minority :he: :yaonion:

**Wayra:** This result can only mean one thing :kthinking: : that one person abstained from voting! :sidea:

**Undya:** :e_e:

**Herman:** Indeed, but who? :maybe: 🧐

He asked, and looked around in the classroom. Several others did the same.

**Undya:** :e_e: 🙈

Undya noticed she was blushing, and tried to reinforce the imaginary walls in front of her emotions that she had used in Marina’s presence, when suddenly:

**Ilya:** Undya didn’t vote! :loco: 🫵 😠

Undya froze. It was too late.

**Undya:** Wha-what? :e_e: :gasp:

She turned around with bright-red cheeks and faced Ilya who was pointing at her, and looking as if not voting - and thus, not getting this issue over with - had been a personal attack on her.


[6/15/2023 7:59 PM] frangipani.
**Undya:** I-I… 😅 :e_e:

The entire class was staring at her now. Undya was sweating immensely, both because of their eyes and the heat inside the room.

(**Undya:** Why is Mrs. Hamor still not here? 😖 :yaonion: But well… gotta tell them at least part of the truth 😓)

**Undya:** I… I wanted to abstain from this vote altogether 😅

She stuttered nervously. Wayra slowly shook her head.

**Wayra:** Well, you have to vote now. Otherwise this debate won't be settled, and I can't write my article :sserio:

**Undya:** D-do I have to? 😅 :yaonion:

**Wayra:** Yup. :sserio:

Wayra nodded. She actually seemed disappointed that someone had abstained from voting. More irritated, however, were Barton and Herman.

**Herman:** You? 🧐 I did not expect an extrovert to be this quiet in the face of a discussion :maybe:. Neither do I believe that you don't have an opinion on such an emotional topic :maybe:.

**Barton:** Seriously? :yao: Girl, you're my friend, I'm counting on you! :yaonion:

(**Undya:** Oof, shit, they both seem… kinda disappointed :e_e: 😖)

**Undya:** Guys… that's not how it is :yaonion: It's, ehm... 😅 I dunno 😅 🙈

**Ilya:** Just pick a side! :loco: :mface:


[6/15/2023 10:41 PM] frangipani.
Ilya's yelling, Barton's curious expression and Herman's skeptical face made Undya even more nervous. She opened her mouth, but it was too dry to make a sound. She felt too exposed, too intimidated, too terrified.

Seconds of awkward silence passed, a few too many for her classmates' taste. Enough for Herman's facial expression to turn from a raised eyebrow into a full-on frown.

**Herman:** So you refuse to pick a side, only out of agreeableness. :serio: Which is, frankly, more insulting than any of the alternatives. :serio:

Undya gasped. Herman could have just as well punched her in the gut, it would have been just as painful.

**Undya:** I-insulting? 😳 😢

**Barton:** I hate to say it, but this time, I agree with Herman :yaogo:. 'Cuz by not picking either of us, you're rejecting both of us, and that's kinda rude. :yaogo: 🤨

Barton commented, barely suppressing his annoyance. It felt like a barrage of tiny needles falling right onto Undya's heart. Herman being critical was one thing, but Barton, too? Tears started to fill her eyes, and she sensed that she wouldn't last long trying to hold them back.


[6/15/2023 10:49 PM] frangipani.
Then, all of a sudden, the loudspeaker in the top right corner of the class made a sound that resembled a cow bell, capturing everyone's attention. After the cow bell had sounded twice, the slightly distorted but still recognizable voice of the principal could be heard:

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Attention! 🤖 The following students shall report to the principal's office immediately: Marina Frank, Undya Griber…

Undya opened her mouth in astonishment.

(**Undya thinking:** Mari and I? 😳)

The principal continued though.

**Principal Morys Sayko:** ...Nayobi Hondor, Sakar Imai…

The camera cut to another classroom, in which Sakar and Nayobi looked up to the loudspeaker, and then at each other in surprise.

**Principal Morys Sayko:** …Ovana Munta, Yohan Nisran, Yorin Nisran, Herman Paul, Mihayl Semai…

The group of teenagers stared at one another, mostly astonished and confused.

**Principal Morys Sayko:** …Sumi Shodo…

The camera showed Sumi next to Sakar, looking up at the loudspeaker.

**Sumi:** Me, too? 😳

**Principal Morys Sayko:** ...Ilya Sigor, Wayra Taron, Barton Wahir…

Ilya looked appalled, while Barton and Wayra seemed somewhat intrigued.

**Principal Morys Sayko:** … and Tornoda Yentem!

Tornoda was the only one who didn't even look away from her phone. Instead she just shrugged and got up from her chair.

**Principal Morys Sayko:** Please report to my office right away. :serio: 🤖

The cowbell rang once again, signalizing that the announcement was over. The camera showed the surprised class for a few seconds, then lingered on Undya's face, which showcased a lot of different emotions at once.

The embarrassment she had just experienced, shown by the blush on her cheeks.
The uncertainty of her terms with Herman and Barton, and of why she had just been called to the Principal's office, shown by the way she bit her lower lip.
And the curiosity of what would await her and her fellow students, as seen by her wide open, now dry eyes.


[6/15/2023 10:49 PM] frangipani.
If someone had told her before how her day would go, Undya wouldn't have believed it.
Especially that the craziest part of this day had just begun.

**END OF CHAPTER 1**


[6/16/2023 10:41 PM] tastaturzvd
**Chapter 2: Missing**

The scene faded into a dark room with loads of crystalloid panels activated all around the chamber. A person appeared to be in a type of workbench. We have seen her before. A mellow brown-pink scalp reflected the light coming through the bright floating screens of light, showing a slight blue hue at the tips of its hair. She was found layed down, head on the desk, induced in a deep but tense sleep, hence the uncomfortable position she passed out.

The camera zooms in, approaching her face, showing her intricate outfit reminiscent of the renowned Naori commander Tedu Kas Omou’s uniform. The crystalline devices showed a barrage of incomprehensible hieroglyphics dancing across the screens, in multiple distinct windows, portraying their own outlandish nature. Some information seemed familiar, photos of landscapes, of people and buildings, can be distinguished among all the chaos.

As the angle focused on them revealing at the same the delicate flower placed on top of the person’s head, the text flashed for a few seconds along with a voice that read out: “Luria, a planet that defies all of our understanding”.


[6/16/2023 10:42 PM] tastaturzvd
The perspective changed, and then it happened again, creating a shuttering effect: “The Naori Command makes contact with the Lurians, a new future for the Meritocracy?”. Noise began to arise, as if voices came out of the screens. The person at the desk started to twitch as it was increasing in volume.

 It happened again: “The beginning of a new era of cultural exchange!”, and again: “How will Lurian life affect our society?”, and again: “Is the future of our science in the seven talents?”. The head titles began to telepathically overwhelm the sleeping person, causing their face to frown in discomfort, up to the point that bam.

The camera entered inside their head shudderingly, as if it had infiltrated its thoughts.
One last header popped up bolded in silence and darkness, pondering the question:

***“Will Nep Kas Omou be the future of Lurian-Cintrean education?”***


[6/17/2023 12:46 PM] tastaturzvd
In a rapid shift of locations, Tedu and the girl in his office appeared to be in a heated argument. Tedu slammed his hands onto his desk, and exclaimed.

**Tedu:** Keit, you must understand this is my job! I have to go in there, my duty demands it! 😠 

**Keit:** There should be a way y-you could stay in here! 🥺 😢

He frowned and brought his hand up to his nose.

**Tedu:** You do realize I am a high ranking agent, don’t you? 🙃 I can’t just stay here when all of the Command’s necessities are out there in Luria. :really: Just as it happened with the war, great needs come with great sacrifices. 😤

Keit stood nervously looking down to the ground, shaking a bit, clearly altered by the argument. She just graduated from Synthesis school, but she had a pending destiny, one that was long overdue.

**Keit:**  Y- You got me a way into the Institute, perhaps you can lend me a hand to find a way out! 😣

**Tedu:** No, I won’t allow that!! :maybe: You didn’t work so hard to adapt yourself to the Institute’s education system just for then throwing all of it out of the window like this! :derp: :kbruh: 

**Keit:** B-But master...🥺 😥

**Tedu:** I am not your master anymore!!! 😠 💢


[6/17/2023 12:46 PM] tastaturzvd
Upon hearing those words, silence spread across the room and tears started to form in Keit’s eyes. Tedu, realizing what he has done, tried to explain further his reasoning.

**Tedu:** Your internship… in this organization ended with the war. 😒 You’ve done great, even with all the criticism fared against you, but I’ve been prolonging your inevitable destitution for far too long. :serio:  You can’t stay in this command any longer. 😓

Slightly muted sobbing could be heard where Keit was. Tedu noticed her mourning, and then approached her with a sigh.

**Tedu:** *Sigh* Look. 😕 Even I have my limits, Keit. :serio: When I saved you all those years ago from the fate the Fort had for you, you were but a little lost girl who had no idea who she was and where to go. :idea: :serio: 

An image of a shy little Keit appeared showing her naive and insecure behavior.

**Tedu:** And look where you are right now. A graduated synthesis bachelorette. ☺️

Tedu crouched and wiped Keit’s tears with his thumb, giving her a warm smile.

A snapshot of her studying and training along with the Naori veteran popped up in her mind. Despite the good moments, she then remembers her failures and struggles which made her even sadder, as she continued sobbing stating:

**Keit:** B-But *sob* I haven't progressed at all! I am still a damn mess… *sob* 😭

**Tedu:** No, that's just not true. :ureally:  You are leagues beyond where you started. You have friends now too, people who will watch your back, even after you finally are assigned a ministry. :serio:  Do you think Leyna, or Omon would agree with you?


[6/17/2023 12:48 PM] tastaturzvd
Keit thought back to her friends, but her insecurities are too much to bear.

**Keit:** I- I am not… sure. *sniff* 😭 😢

Tedu organized Keit's braids in an attempt to show empathy.

**Tedu:** You… can achieve great things without me, I have no doubt about that. :yaogo:  You go after your father after all. As much as family lines aren't as relevant now, I do acknowledge he was a legend in the Command. :idea:  You possess that same potential in your hands. :serio: 

Tedu placed his hand on Keit's head, caressing her.

**Tedu:** However, your time here is over. But know, that I am proud of you. :upatpat: 

**Keit:** But… ma- ehm. Tedu. *sniff* Couldn’t there be another way? To like, bring me along with you? 😢

He closed his eyes.

**Tedu:** I’ve already sai- :serio: 

She continued pressing onwards in denial. 

**Keit:** Or… my class for Refinement specialization? 😖 😓

Tedu seemed to think it for a moment, but then shook his head.

**Tedu:** Keit please, don't make it harder than it already is. 😕
You won't be under my mentorship any longer, I'm sorry.  :serio: 😓

He explained, with a hint of melancholy. Keit looked away in sadness, as if she was ashamed of revealing what she was about to say.

**Keit:** I… I just don't want to lose you. Or… Candi. 🥺 😭

**Tedu:** Keit… please. 😓

*"I don't want to lose anybody anymore"*


[6/21/2023 8:45 PM] tastaturzvd
An unknown time before or after this, in a big and high technological cafeteria, people with very diverse appearances wearing a variation of 7 different uniforms standing for the different ministries, have their own meals and conversations.

The camera focused then on a pair of individuals. One of them drank what appeared to be a glass of jello-like purple liquid. She finished it all quickly, put the glass down, asking the other:

**Leyna:** :soda:  *ahh* You got the news? :yaoc:

`Leyna Kas Aru: Rego Industry architecture and design student, majoring in terrestrial infrastructure. Grey hair, teal eyes and thick eyebrows. Very extraverted but sometimes hot-headed. Talks even to walls.`

**Omon:** Hm-hjm. :serio:

`Omon Sava: Naori Command SCC trainee, majoring in communications and special resources. Grey hair, purple eyes. A highly sincere and loyal friend. Loves tradition and routine.`

**Leyna:** What a pain, don’t ya think? :yao: You know, going from constant evaluation programs to this. :syaogo: I swear this academy is going to drive me *craaaazy* one day, if it hasn’t done that already, that’s for sure. 😂 :yaonion:

Omon, still serious and calm, held his own glass with simple water in it and nodded in return.

 **Leyna:** Like, I get it, that planet is the hotshot and all, but really? :yao: Why *us* of all people!? :huuh: I barely managed to pass my last synth exams!! :yaonion: *Seriously, it was a pain in the ass!*

**Omon:** I believe it could be a mix of circumstances. New opportunities like this often arise after you graduate. :serio: Luria is an entirely new planet that may become very relevant to the future of our society, it only makes sense. :idea: :serio:


[6/21/2023 8:49 PM] tastaturzvd
Out of the sudden, a white haired short guy interrupts nonchalantly their conversation:

**Azar:** What doesn’t make sense, is how a braindead like you entered in the list. :yao:

`Azar Hikami: Naori Command independent researcher who likes to troll people - and anything involving them - for fun. White hair, rare orange eyes. He just doesn’t give a fuck about anything really.`

**Leyna:** Who are you calling braindead!!?? :sderp: 

**Omon:** (So you were listening to us. Always so indiscreet, Azar)  :serio:

**Azar:** I am just… addressing the elephant in the room :yaogo:, or is the term elephant a bit too, archaic for you? :yaoc: 

Azar started to act as if he were pondering something.

**Azar:** Hmm… 🤔 Oh wait, it is, you did fail historic training. :yao: Twice. :malote:😝 

**Leyna:** Gahh!! :gah: (Didn’t have to be so blunt!)

**Omon:** *sigh* 🙄 That, is a good point to consider actually. :really:

**Leyna:** Huh!? :gasp: (You support him!!?) :gah:

**Omon:** I’ve noticed something weird too about this offer. :serio:  There must be a hidden reason for *him* to give it to us. 

Even though he is a high-ranked, the meritocratic system of this world just wouldn’t allow a random set of unworthy students to go there without some proper justification. 

**Azar:** Or maybe just because I am in *your* group that, they couldn’t help but bring you guys along.  :uwu: *hehe~* *stands tall*

Leyna’s and Omon’s face fell in shame.

**Leyna:** (So much ego….) :cwhut:

**Omon:** That… doesn’t make any sense and you know it. :derp: (Even if he is one of the best students of our generation) :really:

**Azar:** *praise to himself*  :uwu:


[6/21/2023 8:52 PM] tastaturzvd
Another two people arrived at the scene upon hearing the conversation.

**Goura:** Hey guys! Did you receive it too!? Did you receive the news!? :malote: 😁 

`Goura Honut:  Naori Command theoretical researcher majoring in chemistry and mineralogy. Black hair guy with green eyes. Very friendly and hyperactive. Crazy in love with rocks to the point of being concerning.`

**Leyna:** H-jhm!! *frantically nods* 😃 

**Goura:** Awesome!! 😄 *Wonder how Lurian terrain is going to look like up-close in Luria's atmosphere* :e_e:

**Omon:** Seems to be unanimous at this point. :maybe:

**Neia:** I’m afraid so. I just took a look at my crystal and couldn’t believe what I saw. :yaogo:

`Neia Amaritan: Talz Field journalist and spokeswoman, majoring in intercolonial communications and service. Half cintrean, half Hatiman with brown skin, hair and eyes. President of the class. Has a talent for investigation unlike any other.`

**Leyna:** Yeah, right!? :e_e:

**Neia:** *giggles* 🤭 My question is though, why all of the sudden? 🧐 I thought these things were meant to be informed in advance. :kthinking:

**Goura:** Well, it’s Nep Tedu! He probably has something awesome prepared for us in Luria! I have no doubt about it! :idea: :malote: *Imagine a whole excavation project* :he:

*Leyna slides over to Goura*

**Leyna:** *Uhhh, I don't think that's going to be it* :e_e:

**Azar:** Yeah. Maybe some random crazy ass experiment or such. :yao: Wouldn’t be surprised if he discovered a new type of mutant lizard or something.  :jajaja: :yaonion: What is it going to be, the Nürst? The WÜRST!? :lmfao:

**Omon:** :kbruh:

**Goura:** That's... the würst joke I've heard all year :derp: :yao:

**Leyna:** Hey don’t talk like that about Mr. Tedu, you little-!! :derp: 💢

Omon holds her by the scarf of her outfit.

**Azar:** What? :uwu: 

A new tall figure with blond hair appears behind Azar.

**???:** Who do you think you are fooling, Azar? :sserio:

**Azar:** Eh? :yaoc:


[6/21/2023 8:56 PM] tastaturzvd
**Zinda:** You should know from registry scripts in all history banks, that the one culprit of the start of the war was Anton Farai, not his fellow comrade. :sserio:

`Zinda Yue: Rego Industry crystalware engineer, with specialization in crystalloid programming. Blond hair, tall, deep grey eyes. So serious that people think she’s a cyborg. Speaks in a monotone voice.`

**Azar:** Bah, I know that too well. :yao: You guys can’t take a joke. 😂

**Leyna:** THAT A'INT NO JOKE! :derp:

**Goura:** Well... kinda. :hehe: :yao:

Neia turned back to Zinda and give her a warm wave.

**Neia:** Zinda, did you get the message too? 😊

**Zinda:** Yes, I did. :sserio: his underling Candanz Korr was brief, but concise. We should prepare to meet with her at 23.00 GSH. 😑

**Omon:** Correct, that's what Master informed me too. :serio:

**Neia:** Right. :yaoc: Omon, Leyna, have you seen Keit lately? :kthinking:

**Leyna:** Ky? :e_e:

Leyna looked back at Omon and then right back at Neia.

 **Leyna:** Now you’ve mentioned it, I haven't seen her today... :cwhut: :e_e:

**Omon:** True... She wasn't where she was supposed to be today. And she left the apartment quite early.  :serio:

**Goura:** Do you think something bad has happened to her? :e_e:

**Azar:** As if I cared. :yao:

Zinda hit Azar in the head.

**Azar:** Ouch!  😣 :yaonion:

As soon as Goura asked that question, a pondering Leyna started to remember where she last saw her friend:

**Leyna:** *intense overthinking* :sus:


[6/21/2023 8:56 PM] tastaturzvd
`In a short flashback, Leyna encountered her friend in a corridor. It seems to be some kind of stressing situation.`

***FB Leyna:*** Ky! Did you pass the exams? Have you passed all of them? What did your master say!?  :e_e:

***FB Keit:*** S-Sorry Leyna. I’ve still got much to do! See ya! B-Bye!  😅 

***FB Leyna:*** Uhhh? Ky, wait!!  :gah: 

`Back to the present.`

**Leyna:** *fumes out of her head* :sus:

**Neia:** Huh. How odd. :sserio:

Suddenly, Leyna started to shout as soon as she had the epiphany.

**Leyna:** ***Ahhhh!!!!***  We need to check for her!!! :loco:

All of her friends became confused at the sudden commotion.

**Azar:** Eh? Why? :tf:

**Zinda:** Wouldn’t she be the first to get this sort of news, Leyna? :sserio:

**Leyna:** Yeah b-b-but, she’s been very stressed! I remember seeing her right after the exams! :loco: Didn’t want to annoy her, but I know her well enough to know she is one to forget and reject everything around her when she gets in stressful situations!! There is a chance she didn’t even pay attention to this at all! :loco: :why: 

*Believe me, she has forgotten things like this in the past! Like when she didn’t get the message about the food exchange before the exams!* :why:

`Flashback opened with Keit and Leyna eating at the cafeteria`

***FB Keit:*** Bleh, why didn’t you tell me any earlier!? 🤮 *I don’t like rimerian food.* 

***FB Leyna:*** You don't!?!? :gah: But there was an announcement! :gah:

**FB Keit:** Now what am I going to eat!? :derp: Ugh... what a day...

`Back to the present. `

**Azar:** Ley, It’s Kas Omou’s ex-disciple who we are talking about. :ureally: I doubt she doesn’t know about this already. :yao:

**Leyna:** But still! This is urgent... its literally hours from now!! We need to contact her asap, otherwise she'll miss it!! :why: :loco:


[6/21/2023 8:57 PM] tastaturzvd
**Leyna:** *She has a tendency to lock herself away when she's stressed* :why:

Goura pondered for one moment, and then reached to a fast but intuitive conclusion.

**Goura:** Then, give me one moment and I'll resolve this problem in a flash with a call! :idea: Just hold on. :yaoc:

He created some crystalline panels and began a call.

**Leyna:** *hair twirls* :yaoc:

**Omon:** *finger tapping* :serio:

**Neia:** *deep breath* 😮‍💨  :sserio:

However, some uncomfortable seconds passed with everyone waiting, with no results.

**Goura:** Huh… she doesn’t seem to respond. :yao:

Leyna slipped and passed just behind Goura’s shoulder with a suspicious face.

**Leyna:** ***It's useless, she won't hear a thing!!!*** :derp:

**Goura:** *AHHHHH!* :gasp:

Startled, Goura fell off and broke the crystal screen screens in front of him.

**Azar:** :lmfao: 🫵 

**Leyna:** Keit probably locked her communications away... :why:

**Goura:** Why would she do that though? :kthinking:

**Leyna:** THAT'S THE THING! :why:  She just doesn't like to be bothered sometimes! :why:

**Azar:** Then just leave her in damn peace :derp:

**Leyna:** **WE CAN'T!!!** :why:

**Neia:** 🤭  *giggles* Relax, relax you two. The first thing to do would be to ask the rest if they have seen her recently. :idea: Let’s split into groups to do it faster. I'll call Master Iwa in the meantime. :sserio: Maybe she knows about her location. :yaogo:

**Leyna:** Yay! Thanks Neia. 😄 🥳 

Goura stood up still with crystals in his hair.

**Goura:** Yeah, thanks Neia! :yao: 😁 

Goura and Leyna did high five, celebrating the decision.

**Neia:** Look there :ukawaii: 🫵 .

Neia points a finger towards two girls having a conversation in the back row of the cafeteria's seats.

**Neia:** You two will go after Urza and Iluia. :yaogo:

**Leyna:** Why these two!? :huuh:

**Goura:** That's... outta be complicated. 😅 

**Neia:** Omon, go try to find Norian. :yaoc:

**Omon:** *nods* Understood. :serio:

**Neia:** Zinda, Azar, go to the academy and do your best to try to find her location, if nothing works, look for Xicaru and Eri. :sserio:

**Azar:** Pfft, seriously? :yaogo:

**Zinda:** *nods* :sserio:

**Neia:** I’m going to go after Hemo and Sathki. :yaoc: 

**Goura:** And... what about Erthoun? :e_e:

**Neia:** He.... left as soon as the exams finished. :sderp: He told me he didn't want anything to do with us anymore. 🙄 

**Azar:** Hah! What a chad. 😂 Now he's gonna miss this shit. :yaonion:

**Neia:** Anyways! 😅  Let's get moving team 👏 , before it gets too late! 😅 

Everyone started moving except Azar who was just crossing his arms as if he didn’t give a damn.

**Zinda:** Could you follow me Az- :really:

**Azar:** Argh, okay fine… :yao: :pressf:

`Mission #1: The luthnean duo`

**Leyna:** Aaaaany idea on how to approach those two? :yao: :e_e:

Goura chuckled a bit jokingly, trying to hide his out-of-character nervousness.

**Goura:** I’ll be honest here, these girls are a mystery even to me. :yao: 

**Leyna:** Yeah… even though her bestie is really sweet, Urza is... ehm. How do I put it? :e_e:

**Goura:** Yeah... I get ya. :e_e:

The two of them walk towards the direction they are located.

**Goura at a distance:** Remember to be formal with them… :yaoc:

The girls in question were seemingly taking their time in the cafeteria. As people who enjoyed some peace and quiet, they liked isolated places, in which barely anyone would dare to disturb their presence. With some tea in their gloved hands - one made out of flowers instead of leaves - they appeared to talk about some important matters.

**Illuia:** So, what are you going to do with it, Rin? 😊 Are you going to accept it or not? It seems quite bold of him to give it out this late, don’t you think? :kthinking:

`Illuia Zu Xin: Him Care medical student majoring in pharmaceutics. Navy blue hair, cyan eyes, compassionate and kind. Always wearing artifacts from a forgotten era.`


[7/11/2023 1:54 PM] tastaturzvd
Her friend looked at the information displayed on the screen implanted in their table. It seemed to have information about a very particular message from Tedu Kas Omou's intern.

**Urza:** *sip of tea* Tsk, I don’t find myself happy with the idea :really:, this offer appears to be rushed and scrapped, almost as if Kas Omou was forced to comply with it. :sus: But what must be done, must be done. My reputation precedes me, and I am nobody to back off from an opportunity like this. :sserio:

`Urza Rin Ohm: Jusnean Tribunal evaluation accountant student majoring in data analysis. Short black hair, red eyes, lover of dark and straightforward mannerisms. A sophisticated heiress from a powerful luthnean family.`

**Illuia:** That’s what I thought. 😌  A diligent student of the Ohm family wouldn’t be so foolish to dismiss this offer, would they? *giggle* :yaogo:

**Urza:** Rgh. *looks away* You are right. *hand on her cheek* *elbow on the table* :maybe:

 **Illuia:** It is rare when a high-ranked officer like himself gets involved in matters of the Institute this extensively. :yaogo: Aren’t you curious what brought Kas Omou to make such an… awkward decision? *index finger in her mouth* :kthinking:

**Urza:** Whichever his reasons may be… :ureally:

Urza closed the window shown in the table’s screen and took another sip of her tea.

**Urza:** I will crush his expectations. :sserio:


[7/11/2023 1:57 PM] tastaturzvd
Leyna and Goura arrived at their seats, visibly nervous of talking to them.

**Leyna:** G-Greetings.

 **Illuia:** Oh, what a pleasant surprise! 😊 What brings you two here?

Urza looked at them with the corner of her eye, piercing them with her gaze.

**Urza:** Yes. Speak. :really: :maybe:

Leyna nervously played with her fingers, shaking, replying:

**Leyna:** I j-just wanted… 😅 to ask you if you have seen Keithra anywhere. 😓 *Oh gee, why is she so scaryyyy!?* :yaonion: :sderp:

Goura brought his hand to his hair and started to scratch himself in the back of his head.

**Goura:** Y-Yeah, what she said. 😅 

`Time freezes`

 `Cue music`

 The two were visibly altered, acting nervously in front of Urza. But who can blame them? 

*Zoomed in to Urza, showing her extravagant outfit*

Urza is one of the granddaughter of one of the most important figures of Luthnee, Wayn Rin Ohm, the grandson of the founder of the Rin Ohm heritage, a family line that fought head-on against the Alphas from Earth a long time ago. 

*Showed both Urza and Iluia, the latter having a big warming smile despite the situation* 

While families are viewed differently among Cintreans, this wouldn’t apply to those mentorship names from the outside, like the likes of the Rin Ohm family.

*Focused on both Leyna and Goura’s nervous expressions, along with Urza’s face*

Urza has been classmates with them for quite some time, allowing them to somewhat climatize with her. She however is also known to be harsh, blunt and direct, qualities that brought her to be feared upon, even among her peers.

`Fade out music`

What? Did I deviate too much? *clears throat* Alright, let’s continue with these fellas.

`Time resumes`

**Urza:** Hpmf, that two braided peasant? *tea glupping* :ureally: She must be somewhere regretting her actions. :sserio:

**Leyna:** Ahh? :gah:

**Goura:** W-What do you mean? Ms. Rin? :e_e:

**Urza:** Haven’t you heard? :ureally:

**Iluia:** Rin probably is referring to the invitation that she guessed you would receive as well. :yaogo: 😌

**Urza:** *nods* Excluding you of course. :sserio: *points at Leyna* :really:

**Leyna:** Ehh!? What are you saying? :gah: I also received it!! :cwhut:

**Urza:** Pfft. Don’t joke with me. :yaogo:  :really:

**Leyna:** (Why no one seem to believe me?) *face falls* :T_T: :derp:


[7/11/2023 2:11 PM] tastaturzvd
**Goura:** Well, actually Ms. Rin Ohm, I wanted to ask you whether you were going to participate in it or not. :yaoc:

Urza immediately jumped to give an answer, as if she was insulted by the question.

**Urza:** Of course I will participate! 😠  *deep breath* ...and so will Xin. :really:

**Iluia:** We’ll be looking forward to seeing you at the reunion. ☺️ 

**Goura:** Great! 😅 

**Leyna:** W-wait wait wait. I don’t seem to understand. Do you know where Vylie is or not? :sus:

**Goura whispering:** She’s a Kas Omou now… :e_e:

**Leyna:** Right! Right, Ms. Kas Omou, hehe. :yao: 😅 

**Urza:** You may look for her in the study rooms. I am positive she may be in there given the circumstances. :serio:

**Leyna:** Oh! That’s actually a good idea! 😄 *Keit always seems to study so much…* 😅 

**Goura:** Yeah, thanks a bunch Ms. Rin Ohm. 🙏 Think we'll be looking for her now. :idea:

**Leyna:** Yeah, see you around!! :yao: 👋

Both seemed happy to have an idea for looking for her, and part their ways to try to find their lost friend.

`Mission state: Is she in the study rooms?`

Urza, however, seemed quite flustered at something.

**Urza:** Rhm… :sus: 💢

`Flashback`

***FB Leyna:*** Right! Right, Ms. Kas Omou, hehe. :yao: 😅 

`Back to present`

**Iluia:** Rin, dear, is something the matter? 😟 

**Urza:** It-It is nothing. :syaogo:

**Urza:** (So she did inherit the Kas Omou lineage. How did that peasant manage to do that? Does this have to do with this invitation? :really:)

`Mission #2: The nature lover`

Omon waited patiently in a broad and highly robust elevator. It made a high pitched sound, indicating its high velocity, as it got deeper and deeper in the building they were a part of. He closed his eyes, tapping his feet. He seemed to be at peace.

A clinging sound is heard: `Floor N3-67, Biomass Storage: NA-Y923`

The forcefield went down, and Omon entered a beautiful crystalline biosphere, full of plants, insects and even animals of all kinds, all contained in a chamber spreading across several hundred meters.

The walls of the sphere deviated the energy of a radiating core in perfect sync, as light panels emulated the natural sky of a lively, micro-biosphere.

Some dragonflies seemed to catch the attention of Omon and try to get into him, but his own personal force field protected him. However, he decided to let one of them bypass them, as it laid on his finger senerily.

But abruptly, a sound scared them away, as then a figure in pink hair appeared on camera.
It was a teenager, wearing a mostly black and white outfit, reminiscent of a forest caretaker, but still with the ensign of the Academy engraved on it.

**Omon:** Just as I assumed, you are here, Norian. Taking care of the chamber, I give? You are aware that it is no longer mandatory, right? :serio:

The teenager addressed him without looking back, busy, taking care of some planets with his panelling system.

**Norian:** The realm of duty does not substitute the one of necessity. :serio: This habitat deserves attention, as it is a delicate balance between care and environmental interaction, if possible. 😌 :serio:

`Norian Amt: Talz Field biologist student with specialization in nature preservation and engineering. Pink hair, gray eyes, of thin complexion. A very quiet guy who deeply enjoys nature.`


[7/11/2023 2:27 PM] tastaturzvd
**Omon:** I see, it doesn’t surprise me. You’ve taken good care of this chamber. Barely seen one evolve as charmingly and captivatingly as this one did. :serio: :yaogo:

**Norian:** Your words resound nicely, Omon. 😌 You see, in counterpoint to them, the ecosystem of this chamber has been carefully fine-tuned to meet the needs of every living creature. From energy nets that adjust the gravitational force applied to the yugurans of Rahava… :idea:

A set of very delicate giant flowers of over 3 meters tall with beautiful purple-crimson petals are shown, balancing over a specialized net.

**Norian:** ...to insulators that take care of simulating the rare and often breath-taking atmospheric pressure of the Moon of Oaun, needed for halvons to survive. :syaogo: 😌

A bird with paper-thin wings similar to that of a bat flew in the sky, in search of a branch to rest on, with a device on its peak. 

**Norian:** Without these systems, it would be impossible for these creatures to co-exist together, in such an impressive, complex environmental cocktail.  :idea:

**Omon:** Seems like Master Hatsu has taught you well. :serio: 

**Norian:** *deep breath* Yes, you could say so. 😅 It is a shame I cannot persist with his tutoring. 😮‍💨 

Omon approached the boy and placed his hand on his shoulder, giving him some moral support.

**Omon:** We all need to continue in our own paths, it is an important lesson we need to learn to accept. :sserio:

**Norian:** I am aware. 😓

**Omon:** You’ve grown much as a person, you are nothing like you’ve been in the past. However, you still have some things you need to work on. :yaogo:

**Norian:** Thanks, friend. :syaogo: Though I still feel quite empty inside. All of this work, yet everything appears to move for a bigger purpose one cannot even control... 😓


[7/11/2023 2:35 PM] tastaturzvd
**Omon:** You are not alone in this. :sserio: [...] I know of a friend that has been struggling with the same thing, you two need to learn from one another to overcome these issues. :serio:

**Norian:** Who do you refer to? 🤨 :hmm: 

**Omon:** *deep breath*

Norian’s face changes from day to night as he realizes who he is meaning, adopting a very serious but disgusted expression.

`Flashback to images pop up in his mind`

***FB Keit:*** Norian, please, just, help me with this. Master Tedu… 😅 :why:

***FB Norian:*** Master Tedu this, Master Tedu that, Keit, you keep using his name to intimidate me! 😡 You have nothing to do with the field of expertise I partake in, you have to accept the rules as they are! You’ve got to learn your place! 🤬  💢

***FB Keit:*** *tears forming* :cwhut: :T_T: 

***FB Norian:*** I-I am sorry. :really: *up close to his mouth* 

But it’s over.

`Back to present`

**Norian:** Her […] :sus:

Norian forcefully let go of Omon’s grip at the slight inferral to Keit’s name.

**Norian:** She has **nothing** to do with what I am going through nor the pain I have to endure!! 😠 You should know of that by now!

**Omon:** I am aware you two have not been… at the best of situations lately. 🙄  However, one should be wary of being ruthless to one another just because of some past difficulties. She’s not been good about it either, but she’ll overcome it. :sserio:

Norian, as a reaction, stopped facing Omon and walked in the opposite direction.

**Norian:** Tell me something I should be concerned about. :really: 💢 *I’m done talking*

Norian proceeded to analyze the soil’s nutrients of the plant he was working on, deviating his attention from the conversation. Omon in response, put his fingers on his dorsum as a sign of frustration, clearly flustered.


[7/11/2023 2:38 PM] tastaturzvd
**Omon:**  I was… going to ask you if you know where she is. She's been missing today... she didn't follow her normal schedule. :really:

**Norian:** And why would you think I would care!? :derp: 💢 She has been manipulating me for months!! 😤  I am just done with anything her or her stupid superior!! :derp: She pulls the string wherever she can!  :really: Is that all you meant to tell me!?!? :really: 💢

**Omon:** No.

Norian continued on for a moment waiting.

**Omon:**: …about the trip. :serio:

And he stopped, still his glove on the dirt.

**Norian:** I’ll pass on that. :really:

**Omon:** [...] Pardon? 🤨 

Replied clearly confused and in disbelief.

**Norian:** It has been way too long since I’ve been following that woman’s footsteps. I no longer desire to do so. :really:

**Omon:** You cannot be serious. :derp: 

**Norian:** [...]

 A moment of silence spread between the two, filling the gap with bird and insect noises. Norian pressed on with his work, a bit more roughly, ignoring him.

**Omon:** Noria- :serio:

**Norian:** Is that all you have to say? :really:

**Omon:**  😕  [...]   

Suddenly, a tiny creature appeared out of some bushes, curious to say hello to Omon. It seemed to be a little rabbit, brown and white. It had a label on one of its ears: which said “Luria”. It started to try to chew on his uniform, when Omon came down and lifted the creature, and started to caress it.


[7/11/2023 2:49 PM] tastaturzvd
**Omon:** *deep breath* 😮‍💨  Norian, look. :serio:

Norian gazed at him.

**Norian:** Yes, it is a Lurian rabbit, so what? :ureally:

**Omon:** No, I’m serious, look. Take a glance at what you have around you. Do you think this habitat is worth sacrificing for just a little itch you have with one person? :serio:

**Norian:** What are you on about? 🙄 

**Omon:** Luria is a planet full of species and habitats, many of which are reminiscent of the old Earth, which is core to the environment that once gave life to us many millions of years ago. Not only represented in this lovely rabbit, but on a broad of countless opportunities for a biologist like you. :serio:

**Omon:** Just think of the possibilities you can get in there as a talzean biologist specialist, they are endless.  Do you really think Master Hatsu would approve of your irrational decision? 🤔 :really:

Norian looked down for a moment or two, pondering. Then, someone saddened, he replied softly:

 **Norian:** No, he wouldn’t. 😔 

**Omon:** Well, what is it then? Do you really care for what you have cultivated in this chamber, or do you care to let go of the opportunity of your life just because you hate someone’s guts? :derp:

**Norian:** Tsk, yes, I ge- I get your point. It… just isn’t fair, you know? 😓

The rabbit jumps off Omon’s arms. Omon then called the elevator once more, arriving very quickly, unlike the elevators of our time. He was about to get in when he added:

**Omon:** I am not going to force you to go, but have in mind that this program is all about cultural exchange. You… don’t have to talk to her if you don’t want to. I, as your friend, recommend you to reconsider this. :serio:

 **Norian:** *back facing at him* I’ll… think about it, alright?

Omon lets out a chuckle and a slight grin.

**Omon:** I’m glad you will. 😌 

`Mission state: FAIL`


[7/11/2023 2:50 PM] tastaturzvd
`Mission #3: The Fort trainee`

Neia appeared walking through a corridor that leads to several rooms, many of which have people in them, training with weapons or without them, in a great variety of martial arts.

She then received a message in her linked cerebral device, in which just she popped up a screen in front of her to see a message from Omon saying:

`Open chat`

**Omon:** Talked with Norian a couple of minutes ago. He doesn’t know a thing.

**Goura:** We managed to talk with Urza. She recommended that we go check the study rooms, we are on our way there.

**Neia:** Great! I just called the Principal... she... doesn't seem to be responding either, weird. And everyone else seems to be out of duty too, it's almost like communications have been hijacked. So I am about to talk to Sathki, please keep me up to date when and if you find her.

**Goura:** Sure thing!

**Omon:** I will check at the cabinets to see if there are any signs of her.

**Neia:** Great idea!

`Close chat`

Meanwhile, Neia just arrived where Sathki is training, undoing her crystalline screen. She enters the room and sees a brown haired girl with light gray robust clothing sparring with a fellow colleague of hers:


[7/11/2023 2:52 PM] tastaturzvd
`In the fighting scene`

The girl, with a dead serious face, and with great expertise and manoeuvring, spinned a staff so fast only blurs can be seen of it. Blue light sparkled across as all the incoming attacks were blocked. A piercing moveset went forward, she dodged it with mastery, as she slided to one side to give a thunderous hit to her opponent. The move was parried, he sled backwards.

The girl propelled herself forward…

`Sathki Naeru: Essence leveling specialist and Fort Force trainee. A very strong but kind hearted individual. Known to be distracted outside of her usual training.`

And now she was prepared to attack: Incredibly precise swings that cause the nearby shield that holds them in the sparring mat to flicker, with blunt shockwaves that can be heard even outside every time they are blocked. Neia watches with astonishment in the background, seeing how she was so committed and focused.

**Neia:** Wow… 😯 :e_e:

Then a vertical swing from her opponent collided with the mat, causing the entire floor to vibrate. 
Why? - Because the girl had evaded the hit so quickly that she managed to put herself behind him. And then, a huge explosive sound, as the stick hits the guy in the back so hard that soon, a sound can be heard from the outside, which forced Neia to plug her ears.

`End of fighting scene`


[7/11/2023 2:57 PM] tastaturzvd
**Computer sounds:** `Alert, alert. Student Yuha below 50%, student Yuha below 50%. Finalizing sparring session.`

The shields went down, Sathki offered a hand to her opponent.

**Sathki:** Hey, not bad! :yaogo: 😄

 The guy touched himself just where she had hit him in the back, as he got up.

**Yuha:** Argh, you got me there good. :yaogo: Couldn’t see a thing. :yao::pressf:

**Sathki:** You weren’t half bad, Yuha. You’ve clearly improved a lot this year. 😁 :ulike:

**Yuha:** Heh, that’s what you always say. :yao: :syaogo:

The guy went to fetch his towel in the back of the room. Neia stood there clapping with the tips of her fingers quickly, with joyful expression.

**Neia:** Woohoo!!! That was incredible, Sath! 🥳  👏 

Sathki perked up, as if she didn’t even realize Neia was there.

**Sathki:** Neia? :yaoc:

Neia went in for a hug, taking her by surprise.

**Neia:** Just look at you 😃 , you’ve gotten so strong!! ☺️ 

**Sathki:** Hehe, it’s nothing really. :yao: *you embarrass me* :syaogo:

**Neia:** Nah, girl. **It is** something. :idea: You almost killed my ears right there. :yao: :pressf: *Should have risen my leveling before entering* 😂


[7/11/2023 3:01 PM] tastaturzvd
**Sathki:** Hehe, thanks Neia. :yaogo: I’ve been training hard ever since last exam. :yao: :pressf:

As Neia heared this, she immediately started comforting her.

**Neia:** Oh, is that because of…? 😟

**Sathki:** Yeah. I don’t want that to happen, and to disappoint them again. 😓

Sathki looked sad for a moment, but then as soon as Neia noticed, she rushed in saying:

**Neia:** Well, I bet your master would be so happy to see you here, being a whole wunky bunky with her training. 😁 :malote:

Neia grabbed Sathki’s head, rubbed it with her knuckles.

**Sathki:** Haha, stop it! 😂 :yao:

She mocked her a little bit before letting go of her.

**Neia:** You’ll do it better next time, you know I mean it when I say that. 😊

**Sathki:** Yeah. T-Thanks for that. ☺️


[7/11/2023 3:08 PM] tastaturzvd
Then the big guy appears again with a towel on his neck, and asks Neia.

**Yuha:** Hey, Amaritan. :yaogo: Why did you come all the way here? Don’t you have stuff to do as the president of your group? :yao: :sus:

Neia became stunned as she realized.

**Neia:** Ah, I almost forgot what I was meant to ask you. 😂 Have you seen Keit anywhere in here? :yao: *I know she frequent this place for training with her swords* :yaoc:

Both Sathki and Yuha looked at each other. They lifted their arms and shoulders in unison.

**Sathki:** Not really. 🤷‍♀️  Has something happened? 😧 

**Neia:** Ohhhh! Oh Oh, yeah!! :yao: In fact, something REAL big has happened. :yaonion: Here, let me show ya. :sidea:

Neia created a big floating panel for both to see. The panel showed the message she received from Tedu. Both Sathki and Yuha came close to read what it said.

**Sathki:** Please come to the.. Ahem, ahem. An opportunity given by Luria’s governments.. Aham. 🧐 

**Yuha:** Wow, this seems like, totally impressive, Amaritan. :e_e: 

**Neia:** Thank you! 😄 Well, the point of it all is, that this came from Keit’s ex-tutor - because he isn’t anymore, she finished his tutoring, haha - :yao: 

Uhh, and well, she just disappeared ever since, and now we all are looking for he- :yaoc: [...] hold on one second. Haven’t you received the message as well, Sath? :sus:


[7/11/2023 3:16 PM] tastaturzvd
**Sathki:** Uh? Uhm, no? :tf: Not that I am aware of. :e_e:

**Neia:** *gasp* :gasp: There is no way you haven’t received that message yet!! :loco: Let me check your system! :sus:

Neia jumped forth and forced a panel up Sathki’s Great Link system to check her inbox.

**Sathki:** Hey!! What are y-!? Not in front o-!! :gah:

After a couple of seconds, she finds it and opens it.

**Neia:** Here! Look! :yao: :ureally:

Sathki checked and her eyes widened as she realized she really didn’t check her inbox. 

**Sathki:** Ohh… :e_e: 😅 

**Neia:** 🤦‍♀️  You need to be more careful with these things!! :sderp:

Yuha leaned forward to read it as well.

**Yuha:** I can’t believe it! :gah: Congrats Sath!! 😄

Sathki however was focused on something completely different.

**Sathki:** Soooorry. 😟  It really slipped my mind. :T_T: 

**Neia:** You need to be more careful with these things, the reunion is less than 2 hours. :yao: Now, please come when the time comes to it, I gotta continue searching for Keit, alright? :yaogo: 🥺 

**Sathki:** O-Okay! 😅 

**Neia:** Welp, good to see you both. :yaogo: Keep up the training! Bye! 😄 👋

Neia left the room in a hurry.

`Mission state: FAIL`


[7/11/2023 3:19 PM] tastaturzvd
As Sathki waved her hand to say goodbye, her face shifted from a happy one to a guilty one.

Yuha hit her on the back, attempting to lift her mood.

**Yuha:** C'mon, ya shouldn’t think too much about it. :yaogo: Just look at the opportunity you received! It is awesome! 😄 I am proud you. :upatpat: 

**Sathki:** Yeah… thanks mate. :yaogo: 😓 

`Flashback`

Sathki appeared to check her system, just before training with Yuha.

However, as soon as she looked up the message, and looked from whom it's coming, she froze. Her heart started pounding, her breathing to rise up.

And so, she just ignored it.

`Back to present`

`Mission #4: The redhead, and the tail`

In a view from outside the magnificent skyscrappers of the academy, one can see how tunnels of energy connect its different sectors. Lines of light of different colours appear to move quickly from one sector to another, like cables of pure energy.

 Inside one of those tubes, two beams of light coloured orange and grey move quickly from one section to the other. 

They go so fast that we can barely see what is happening through all the movement, however, upon arriving, Zinda and Azar materialize in a door, the two very different states:

**Azar:** Ahhh! :loco: *falls to floor* 😖  *grunt* 

**Zinda:** *arrives with complete elegance and flawlessness*

**Azar:** Phew! *stands up* Darn, Zinda. *pant*  Did you have to put it that fast? *pant* :yao: :pressf:

**Zinda:** Yes, this is of utmost importance, so that we get to find Keit before we get called to by Sat. Korr. :sserio:

Azar looked with a fallen face.

**Azar:** You don’t say… :cwhut: :derp:

 **Zinda:** Come, if Eri and Xicaru do not know where she went, she must be somewhere in here, I’m quite sure of it. :sserio:

As they got inside the room they just entered, a hall of incredible proportions was shown, along with a sign that said: “Utam Institute” in cintrean.

Stations, pathways towards personalized rooms, futuristic decorations of all sizes, and people chit chatting. Everything is there. This was truly the epicentre of all movements in this cintrean education metropolis.


[7/11/2023 3:27 PM] tastaturzvd
Both walked first to the main reception of the building. 

**Zinda:** But first, let’s ask the archiver if she knows anything. :sserio:

Zinda placed a hand in a bubble of what seemed to be a sort of goo-ish gelatin. She then closed her eyes, and after some time when her identity was confirmed, her entire peripheral vision seemed to shift to a wondrous spiral of archives that spiraled endlessly to the top, in a completely immersive experience. 

Then, a woman with golden hair and yellow eyes showed up in front of her, as a glowing figure wearing the Academy’s renowned staff outfit.

**Archiver:** Welcome, Zinda Yue. How may I help you today? 😊

She said in a very polite voice.

**Zinda:** I wish to know where Keithra Kas Omou is currently located. :sserio:

The archives in the landscape move like clogging machinery, till the point a glowing blue book appears at the hands’ reach for the Archiver to read.

**Archiver:** Hmm. Seems like the registry of Keithra Kas Omou, formerly known as Keithra Vylie, is currently under restricted access. 🧐 

**Zinda:** Who locked it away? :sserio: 🤨 

The archiver flipped some pages of the book, until she then grabbed something and opened it with her hand: A hologram of Keithra herself.

**Archiver:** As it appears in the registry, she did. :sserio: However this is strictly against protocols, the nature of this breach is unknown. :sserio:

Zinda’s eyes widened, showing surprise at the best of her capabilities - which means, still dead serious. 

**Zinda:** Then, look instead for the registry of Xicaru and Eri Inoi, can you find where they are? :sserio:

The archives moved once more, until two glowing books came down. She grabbed them both and said:

**Archiver:** That is information I can disclose for you. 😌

As the Archiver explained where they are...

Zinda smirked slightly.


[7/11/2023 3:31 PM] tastaturzvd
In the physical world, Zinda took out her hand and opened her eyes. Azar curiosly look at her and asked her:

**Azar:** So? :yaogo:

**Zinda:** Keithra indeed had locked access to her registry. Seems like she doesn’t want anyone to find her. :sserio:

**Azar:** Pfft. :yaogo: Why would the girl want something like that, aside from being a total coward ass? :yaonion: :malote:

**Zinda:** Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t bother to continue searching for her. :sserio: But, given that Leyna is worried about her and the situation is imperative due to how immediate the reunion is. We have to keep pushing. :ureally:

**Azar:** And that is to break the privacy rules and go crack her location anyways. :yaogo: Hah, how very respectful of you :yao: Ms. All I Do Is Correct. :malote:*raises eyebrows* *raises eyebrows* :uwu:

And her fist fell on top of Azar's head once more, like an anvil in Minecraft.

**Azar:** OUGH!! 😖 

**Zinda:** We can do either of two things: Or we find an excuse to bypass her privacy limiter, like asking her for a task under staff regulation, or we go talk to Eri and Xicaru like the original plan intended. :sserio:

**Azar:** Hehe, the first one sounds like more fun. :malote: :he:

**Zinda:** We are going to do the latter. :sserio:

**Azar:** Awww, C’MON!! :yao::pressf:


[7/11/2023 3:34 PM] tastaturzvd
Meanwhile, in what seemed to be a big recreation area within the Academy, one could see a bunch of different crystals, objects and filaments spread across a rectangular area enclosed by an electric net. Sounds of games of all kinds are heard in the background. 

 A guy with a braided tail could be seen with what appeared to be something similar to a golfing stick. He crouches and places the ball in an inverted cone, preparing to launch a strike.

**???:** Steady… steady. :serio:

He said. A girl with curly orange hair accompanies him. She seemed to be growing impatient, as she held her arms close to her torso.

**???:** Xicaru, can I try now? You already tried it like... 20 times. 😅 

**Xicaru:** Shhh! I am trying to concentrate here!!  :derp: :really:

`Xicaru Inoi, Naori Command negotiator and strategist. A proud and energetic fella that strives to become successful in his very own ways.`

The boy seemed to have a not so good friendship with his friend, always being blunt with her whenever he found himself stressed. She however…

**Xicaru:** Steady. :serio:

**???:** But… 

**Xicaru:** I said, shut it!! 😤

Eri closed her eyes as she shut.

**Eri:** Hm! 😖 

… couldn’t do much about it either.

`Eri Inoi: Naori Command archiving student with emphasis on historical research. Often finds herself in very uncomfortable situations.`

**Xicaru:** GO!! 😠

And the ball ran across the entire construction, and just like a pinball game, it hit across all of the different elements in the DIY construct, finally reaching the end point in the background. A sheering tone can be heard as soon as it hits the end. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuHKLyGZ1fE


[7/11/2023 3:39 PM] tastaturzvd
**Xicaru:** YES!! FINALLY!! 🥳  

**Eri:** C-Can I try now? 😅 

Xicaru backed the stick from her, avoiding it to get grabbed.

**Xicaru:** NO! You were too damn impatient!! 😠 💢

**Eri:** But… I was just waiting… 😟

**Xicaru:** Nah nah nah. :sderp: You now have to pay for it. 😠 🫵 Let me do it once more, and maybe I’ll give you another go. 🙄 

**Eri:** But…  :T_T:  *I haven't tried even once...*

However, thankfully for Eri, a pair of known figures arrive at the scene.

**Eri:** *notices* Ohh! Hi Zinda, h-hi Azar!! 😅 👋

Xicaru made his throw just at the moment, but as soon as she heard those names, a smile drew on his face, as he was a whole different person.


[7/11/2023 3:43 PM] tastaturzvd
**Xicaru:** HEYA!! How is it going buddy!!?? 😁 :malote:

 Both Xicaru and Azar made a handshake that appeared to be a common cintrean sign of friendship. 

**Azar:** Not much really. :yaogo:

**Xicaru:** Are you here to have fun like me as well!?? :he: Here, I wanna play “Rock Spot!”!? :malote: I just hit the jackpot a few moments ago. :excelente: 

**Azar:** Pfft. Bet you spent like a billion tries grinding that out of your ass. :lmfao:

**Xicaru:** Ya bet!! :yao: This shit is so freaking complicated. :yaonion:

**Azar:** Naaah. Really? :uwu: Don’t tell me the Hamiltonian trajectory of a rock ball within an inverted heptagram in the game of "Rock Spot!" is that complicated to you… you just need to take into account about 10⁷² possible outcomes. There are much more complex systems than this. :uwu:

**Xicaru:** 🤣 

**Azar:** Thought so. :lmfao:

**Xicaru:** Show off.  :yaogo:

**Xicaru:** So, you wanna play a round? :malote:

Xicaru offered his “Rock spot!” club.

**Azar:** Sure!! Why n- :yaogo:

And when he was about to grab the stick… Zinda interrupted.

**Zinda:** We were here to look for Keit. :sserio:

**Azar:** :cwhut: (Seriously… now!?!? :derp:)


[7/11/2023 3:51 PM] tastaturzvd
Xicaru lowered the club and then glanced at Zinda. He raised an eyebrow in confusion. The atmosphere was starting to change.

**Xicaru:** Why her? 😑

He asked, much more seriously.

**Azar:** (And… there goes the fun. :sderp: :pressf:)

Eri perked up in her seat nearby, as soon as she heard about Keit.

**Zinda:** You probably also received the news, right? :ureally:

**Xicaru:** So… was that all her plan? I was thinking it was weird that it came all of the sudden. :really: I thought that it was all quite absurd. Like man, seriously? Going to Luria, that planet full of prehistoric apes? :sderp: What’s the fun in that? :derp: 😤 - As far as I am concerned she was the only one all obsessed about it. :really: 💢

He again completely shifted personally and tone of voice. His demeanour and even body expressions were completely different.


[7/11/2023 5:26 PM] tastaturzvd
**Zinda:** While I agree it was quite sudden, I don’t think the prospect of going to Luria is all that bad. It is a suggestion from Tedu Kas Omou, after all. :ureally:

Xicaru clenched his fist.

**Xicaru:** Tsk, yeah, a suggestion that probably that brat manipulated to make Master Tedu tolerate that idea and pull it off!!  :sderp: There is NO WAY he would agree to something as ridiculous as that on his own!! 😠 💢

**Zinda:** You know he is not your current master, don’t you? :really:

**Xicaru:** Neither is hers anymore!! And I have NO IDEA why she inherited HIS name and not ME!! 😡 I WAS also under his TUTELAGE!! 😡

Xicaru screams seemed to call the attention of people among the area. Eri was terrified of him, hiding in her corner in fear.

**Azar:** Dude… chill out. :derp:

**Zinda:** Yes, this just won’t lead you anywhere. :ureally:

**Xicaru:** Rrgh.. I just. 😤  I wanted. :derp: Rgh… forget it. [...] I- I don’t want to play anymore. :really: 😞 

Xicaru dropped his club on the floor and proceeded to walk slowly to the exit.

**Xicaru:** Eri… come… 😞 

**Eri:** I.. would prefer to… 😅 

**Xicaru:** I SAID - COME!! 😡

**Eri:** R-Right away!! 😰 

Eri nervously went in to follow him. She faced both Azar and Zinda, and making babbles, she said “Sorry” to them.

`Mission state: FATALITY`

**Azar:** *inhale* *exhale* I predicted this was coming. :sderp: *hands in his pockets* :really: :kbruh:

**Zinda:** You never know until you try. :ureally:

**Azar:** Yeah, yeah yeah. Whatever. 🙄 I’ll go buy myself some sparkling water. :really:

Zinda, mantaining her usual calmness, followed him suit.


[7/11/2023 5:31 PM] tastaturzvd
`Mission #5: The Orion star`

Neia once more walked through a corridor, this time one much more metallic than the latter, as her steps were clinging as she did. She opened her chat again, asking for details on the mission at hand:

`Open chat`

**Omon:** She isn’t in our cabinet, nor in any other I know of as it seems.

**Neia:** So… what happened @Azar, @Zinda? I already talked with Sathki. She doesn’t know anything either…

**Azar:** Bah, we found them playing “Rock spot!” in the recreation area. Let’s say dude just completely threw it off the goal and then panicked like a little girl.

**Zinda:** We also checked the archive. It appears that access to her location was restricted, which shouldn't be possible under normal circumstances.

**Neia:** Restricted!? That... sounds off.

**Leyna:** Told ya somethin weird's happening!! We are checking all the study rooms right nowwaaasdwda.

**Neia:** Leyna, you alright?

**Leyna:** Oops! Sorry. I just got jumpscared by a *little*, explosion, hehe.

**Goura:** We are at the chemistry department!! This place rocks I tell ya!!

**Azar:** Hah! Good one Gou.

**Neia:** Then very well! I am about to reach Hemo’s hangar right now. I’ll inform ya if I have any good news.

**Azar:** Pfft. Doubt it.

**Leyna:** Good luck!!

`Close chat`


[7/11/2023 5:41 PM] tastaturzvd
**Neia:** (Darn… this is going way worse than I anticipated. :derp: Where could have this girl hidden? 😫 And why was her registry locked!?? :derp: If no one ends up finding her, what will the principal think!??. :sderp: 😣 ) 

`Flashback at the principal’s office`

***FP Neia:*** Heya! Master Iwa. 😅 I wanted to ask y-

***FP Principal Iwa:*** Yes? Speak, Amaritan. What is your business here? :really:

***FP Neia:*** Ehhh... it nothing big really, it was just *teeny tiny* inconvenience my group and I had. 👌 😅 I hope you don't mind. 👀 

***FP Principal Iwa:*** A "*teeny tiny*" one? Really? 🧐  I find that difficult to believe. :really:

***FP Neia:*** Eheheh- Sorry!! 😅 

`End of flashback`

**Neia:** (I really, really wanna avoid this from becoming a mess. She wouldn’t like at all if one of us gets missing like this… even worse this close to a meeting. :sderp: :pressf:)

A big metallic door with a red and green light bulb on its corner appeared where she was heading.

**Neia:** (I really hope Hemo can help us with this… 😓 )


[7/11/2023 5:50 PM] tastaturzvd
As Neia arrived there, she rang a bell button on the right of the gate. A raspy voice is heard from behind the door, quite unpleased.

*???:* Yes!?!?

**Neia:** Hemo!! It’s me, Neia. :yao: I have an important issue, and I really need your help!! 😅 

*Hemo:* I am busy over here!!

**Neia:** Please, I am running out of time!! :sderp: It is really, *really* important!! 😅 

*Hemo:*  Then what is it? - spit it out already!!

**Neia:** It is regarding Keit!! Please, you need to help me!! 😅  :pressf:

Some seconds passed without anything happening, but soon a big metallic noise can be heard, as the gate slowly opens due to its antic mechanical properties.

Behind it, a very disorganised but fascinating workshop could be seen. Tools of all sizes and types everywhere. Computers and archives. Mechanical parts of robots and intricate machinery in baskets and thrown across the floor. Impressive gears and condensers, even entire machines and even vehicles created from scratch. 

And at the centre of it all, a big table and a green-haired man in spacecraft clothing, with goggles in his head, holding a round device he was adjusting, and his companion robot, a small 50 cm tall creature with expressive eyes displayed on a screen.

**Hemo:** Regarding Twolocks, you say? 🤨 *spins wrench in hand* 🔧  Now, what are you on about? :serio:

`Hemo Kirskis IV: Rego Industry inventor, mechanical and electrical engineer student. An orian intern that prefers to work on his own. He is an expert at his inventions, but has a difficult attitude due to his provenance.`


[7/11/2023 5:54 PM] tastaturzvd
**Hemo:** Rsshh, hey! Trinket! Where do you think you’re going!? :derp: 😤 

The robot seemed happy to see Neia, and just like a combination of WALL-E and Star Wars robot, proceeded to make sounds as it slightly approached her right leg.

**Neia:** Oh hey! 😄 Trinket, how are you doing? 😊

The robot shook, showing his excitement.

**Hemo:** Nooo, no, no, no. No mister. You are not going anywhere. :derp: *points wrench*

 Hemo went in and took and lifted the robot, putting it in a container he has for it.

**Hemo:** Stay there. 🤨 ☝️ 

*Robot sounds intensifies*

**Hemo:** No!! Bad robot. 😤 Stay.  🙃 🫵 

*Robot sounds de-tensifies*

**Neia:** 😂 🤭


[7/11/2023 6:01 PM] tastaturzvd
Then he faced Neia and crossed his arms.

**Hemo:** So, prez. Are you gonna explain yourself? 🤨 :serio:

**Neia:** Ehm, well you see. :yaogo: We all kinda agreed on a whole mission to look for Keit everywhere we could and ask anyone we knew where she was because… she disappeared!! Like, for real!!! Not even registry can locate her!! :derp:

`Flashback`

Leyna appeared in the scene explaining the group about her concerns.

**Neia:** She apparently hasn't be in the places she was meant be...

Then a short of scene of Sathki and Yuha shrugging.

**Neia:** Nor anyone has seen her anywhere...

`End of flashback`

**Neia:** It is so weird!! I have never seen her act like this, not even when she was afraid of all of us at the beginning. :derp: 

**Hemo:** Wait. So you say that she disappeared? :serio:

**Neia:** Yeah… :sderp:

**Hemo:** Like, without a trace? 🤨 

**Neia:** Yeah!! :derp:

**Hemo:** That's odd… I would swear I saw her a couple of hours ago. :maybe: 

**Neia:** HUH!? So you have seen her!?? 😳

**Hemo:** Hmm! It was when I was going to pick up some cold oil at the repository... 🤔

`Flashback`

An scene of Hemo picking some oil appeared. Multiple spaceships and vehicles stored in there.

 **Hemo:** ...when I saw her talking with a random blond woman in the entrance to a spaceship.

The woman and Keit both wore a hood to hide her identity, talking to Keit in secret, as if they were attempting to not be heard.

**Hemo:** They appear to wear what I would swear was some sort of hood. Like to appear all unnoticed. I have no idea why...

The woman then entered the spaceship and started its engine to exit the repository. Keit then swiftly tried to go away unnoticed. 

`End of flashback`

**Hemo:** ... nor where she went afterwards. 🤷‍♂️ :sus:


[7/11/2023 6:17 PM] tastaturzvd
**Neia:** Hold up. Hooold up one second. :sus: You say: "a blond woman in a hood"? :kthinking: :sus:

**Hemo:** Yeah, I swear I thought I was in some of the "good stuff". :derp: If you know what I mean by that. :really:

Neia quickly grabbed the bright nucleus of her Great Link system and then expanded it all around her in multiple panels.

Trinket reacted moving side by side, making his usual sounds.

**Hemo:** W-What are you doing? :e_e: No panelling in my hangar!! 😤 :really:

**Neia:** I am just searching for something, just, give me, one [...] second! :sidea:

Then Neia grabbed one piece of data out of one of the panels, and it quickly expanded in a 3d figure of Candanz Korr.

**Neia:** Is this the person you saw? :sserio:

**Hemo:** Hmm, this is Candanz Korr, isn't she? 🧐  Omon's current mentor? :sserio:

**Neia:** Not exactly his "mentor" :yao: But she is. :sserio:

**Hemo:** I also thought it could be her but, why? Why appear unnoticed that way? 🤔 :sus:

**Neia:** *deep breath* 😮‍💨  Well, I have my theories on that. :sserio: Look, you also received this message, didn't you? :serio:

She then threw the same message she showed Sathki and Yuha before.

**Hemo:** Sure did. :yaogo:  Quite all of the sudden for a call-in reunion, to be frank. :derp:

The message and the hologram returned to her system.

**Neia:** Exactly what everyone has been pointing out! :derp: :sus: Something tells me that this offer we currently have, is not official as per the usual methods... :sserio: but instead :idea: as some sort of loophole that Nep Kas Omou is taking advantage of. :kthinking: I am not.... really sure why. :sus:


[7/11/2023 6:31 PM] tastaturzvd
**Hemo:** Huh. Now you say it like that. :sus: Kas Omou really is known to be one to not play by the usual game, but instead, by his very own rules. :serio: Hmpf! Quite the brave fella, I tell ya. :yaogo:

**Neia:** *nods* Yes, that is my suspicion too. :sserio: What if Keit is being hidden not because she doesn’t want us to know where she is... :kthinking: but because *he* doesn’t. :idea:.

Just to avoid any possible, “sketchiness”. :sserio:

**Hemo:** That somehow makes sense. Keit wouldn't be capable of locking her registry on her own.  :serio: Then… what is your plan of action? :ureally:

**Neia:**  😏 [...] Do you still have that artefact you used to cheat on your exams back in the day? The one I didn't report because you begged me for it? 🤭 *hehe*
 
**Hemo:** 🙄 Yeah… don't bring that up. :really: And don't tell me *you* of all people want me to use that again. :derp: 

**Neia:** Hehe, you're damn right. :malote: We already finished the exams anyways, we aren't on course right now, so it can't be that bad. :yaogo:  And since we know it IS a higher up that locked her up against protocol, it only would make it better if we catch them red-handed, don't you think? :malote: Let’s give it a different, more ethical use, shall we? :excelente:  :he:

**Hemo:** And here... we... go 🙄


[7/11/2023 6:52 PM] tastaturzvd
Meanwhile, in the study rooms, Leyna and Goura checked up on the last one of them, with no success.

**Goura:** Aaaaaand. That makes up for the last one. :yao: :pressf: *exists automatic door*

**Leyna:** Awww… where could she have gone!?? :T_T: Now I am worried that I somehow annoyed her or something… :kcrying: 

Goura patted her back in an attempt to calm her down.

**Goura:** Ley, I don’t think she has, don’t worry. :yaogo: Probably she is somewhere we still haven’t looked! :idea: This place is quite big, there are a lot of places she could have gone to really. :e_e:

**Leyna:** Yeah but… w-why is she making it so hard? :why: What have I done wrong? :kcrying: 

Leyna brought her hands to her face to sob. 

But all of the sudden, out of nowhere, the lights seemed to strangely fade in and fade out, as if the overall network system of the space station was resetting.

Then, and announcement came in: 

**Main computer:** `Members of the Academy, our systems are resetting, please stand by.`  🤖 

**Main computer:** `Members of the Academy, our systems are resetting, please stand by.`  🤖 

**Leyna:** Huh!?? :huuh: 

**Goura:** Woah, what was that? :cwhut:

Suddenly Goura’s pupil started to flicker. 

**Goura:** Ehhh, a call? :e_e: :gasp:

Goura opened up a panel and accepted it.


[7/11/2023 7:01 PM] tastaturzvd
`In the call`

**Goura:** Neia?? :cwhut: What’s going on?? :loco:  :e_e:

**Azar:** Yeah, what the heck Neia!! I didn’t sign up for a chaos like this!! :derp:

**Neia:** Hemo and I have done some… “work”, to the Academy’s systems. :excelente: Don’t worry guys, it isn’t as bad as it sounds! 😆  We just discovered why Keit is nowhere to be found: Tedu has been playing undercover this whole time, that’s why our announcements were so sudden. :sidea: 

**Azar:** But then why in heck did you hack into the freaking operative system!!?? 😤 :derp: 

**Neia:** We’ll just extract the data regarding her ubication :syaogo:, don’t fret! 😄 

**Omon:** Isn’t that a bit too dangerous? :sserio:

From Neia’s and Hemo’s perspective in the hangar:

**Neia:** Nah… relax. It will be fine. :yaogo: It is under my duty to make sure she is safe and sound! Especially under this circumstances. :idea:

Hemo, using his old dusty "analogical" computers, finally managed to load all of the necessary data.

**Hemo:** Give me a sec… loading… :serio:


[7/11/2023 7:03 PM] tastaturzvd
**Hemo:** Done!! [...] She is in Cabinet AZD-B27! :serio:

**Neia:** You heard that!? :sserio:

**Omon:** Huh, AZD… I was near that area before. :serio:

**Leyna:** *gasp*  :gah: That’s…

Suddenly something clicked inside Neia’s mind.

**Neia:** Wait. W-W-Wait Hemo. Did you say, B-27? :gah: A-Are you sure that’s legit? :e_e:

**Hemo:** Yeah, it is what it says in here! Don’t you listen!!? :derp:

**Neia:** No way… :cwhut:

**Neia and Leyna:** THAT’S THE PRINCIPAL’S PERSONAL CABINET!! :loco: :gasp:


[7/11/2023 7:09 PM] tastaturzvd
[...]

In a complete change of scenery, we are sent to a moment inside a cabinet, in which Keit had entered with a deeply saddened face. Marks of tears could be seen on her face, as she looked down in agony.

A voice we had heard of before greeted her from a couch, in a tone of voice much different to the one Neia was used to hearing, smoking a mechanical cigarette.

[7/11/2023 7:32 PM] tastaturzvd
**Principal Iwa:** *blows smoke* Oh, hello there, my dear.  Please, come in. 😌

Keit entered deeper into the poorly lighted room, a sign of Iwa’s particular preferences, her eyes glowing a blue hue for compensation.

**Principal Iwa:** How has your reunion gone? 😌 

She then sat next to the principal, and upon hearing that question, she just couldn’t hold whatever she brought her back anymore, and started sobbing uncontrollably.

**Keit:** I-I just.. :T_T:

**Principal Iwa:** Oh, are you okay my dear? Just tell me what happened.

Said quite concerned, coming a little bit closer.

**Keit:** I… just. :T_T: c-couldn’t c-c-convince him to s-stay. 😭 He… he said he wasn’t m-my master anymore… I-I. I-I can’t handle it. :kcrying:

She continued on sobbing, incapable of even speaking clearly.

**Principal Iwa:** *holding her cigarette* Look, I won’t say I didn’t warn you but, you know how Tedu is. :ureally: Loyal, reliable, you name it. Even if he had his fair share of rebellious moves in his time, his curriculum is nothing to scoff at. :sserio:

He would fight all he can to make justice to his peers but, at the end of day, just like it happened with his inseparable co-worker Anton Farai, he would surrender to the system once he realizes he can’t do anything about it. :sserio:

Keit, still full of tears on her face and a runny nose, sobbing, replied:

**Keit:** B-But t-then, w-what am I supposed to do?? S-Stay in here? I-I worked u-under his wing for almost h-half my life n-now, and then am I s-supposed to believe I did all of t-that for nothing?!? 😭 :kcrying:


[7/11/2023 7:34 PM] tastaturzvd
**Principal Iwa:** *uses her cigarette* Dear, it wasn’t for nothing. :ureally: Your internship in the Command was an exception the Authority made due to the likes of the war. :sserio:

Believe me when I say that everyone, doesn’t matter their age or occupation, one way or the other, were affected by the might of those merciless creatures. Your experience there will be taken into account, I can promise you that. Not everybody has the chance of working with a second-ranked official, let alone inheriting their mentorship line.  :ureally:

Keit stopped sobbing for a second, and looked at the principal with her affected eyes.

**Keit:** B-But 🥺 , I don't mean the experience I got from him. B-But… but rather. That h-he was like a father to me. :kcrying:

Iwa's expression changed to that of sympathy as soon as she heard that.

**Keit:** I… used to live in the Command. It used to be my home!! 😭 :why: I-I can't bear the thought of l-losing someone like him. I-I. I just can't. Not again, not a-after him. 😭

The principal shook her mechanical cigarette for a moment, thinking to herself.

**Principal Iwa:** You mean of the pink-haired biologist, do you not? :ureally:

Keit slowly nodded.


[7/11/2023 7:38 PM] tastaturzvd
**Principal Iwa:** [...] You are a great student, Keit. :sserio:

**Keit:** H-huh?  :T_T:

**Principal Iwa:** Not only did you manage to accomplish, *most*, of what was asked of you in Synthesis School, but you also had a double the job by being in the Command at the same time as well. :sserio: Your masters at the institute are quite pleased by your efforts and your commitment, despite the circumstances and the gaps. [...] I… I think I can try making an exception for you. 😌 😓 

*Keit rubbed her eyes to try to dry her tears.*

**Keit:** Y-You, you mean it? 🥺 

**Principal Iwa:** *deep breath* 😮‍💨 It won’t be easy. :ureally: I will have to talk with your former master and make the necessary arrangements. 😑

Keit rapidly hugged the principal as she said that.

**Keit:** Thanks.. M-Master Iwa, i-it means a lot. 🥺 :sheart:

The principal wrapped her other arm around the girl, smiled, and replied:

**Principal Iwa:** Don’t tell anyone though. 😌 I will do what is necessary to see this one through. :sidea: 

**Keit:** But how? They are going to question me! 🥺

**Principal Iwa:** You can come to my place, they won't know you are here. :yaogo:

They will know what's going to happen, when the time comes down to it.

`Back to the present, in Goura’s and Leyna’s perspective:`

**Goura:** What!? In the principal’s cabinet!? :loco: 

**Neia:** Yeah, that’s what Hemo told me!! :cwhut: :derp:

**Leyna:** Hehh!?? :gah: but why!?? :gah: 

**Neia:** I have no idea!!! :derp:

**Azar:** Ooooh, great! We’ve reaaaaally done it now. :yao: :yaonion: I was nice to meet you all (?? :yaonion:

**Goura:** Heck! What do we do!?!?! :derp: :loco:

**Zinda:** I would recommend whoever is nearest to check on her regardless. :serio: If the principal went into all of this trouble to hide Keit’s ubication, then it wouldn’t be surprising that she isn’t playing fair either. She can’t do anything to us regardless. :serio: :really:

**Azar:** What!? Have you lost your mind!? :e_e:

**Omon:** No no, it is a fair point, Azar. It wouldn’t be legal to hide or tell someone to hide their location like this outside of the registry. It would be highly suspicious.  :serio:

**Azar:** Huh, now that made more sense than it should have. :yao: :lmfao:

**Neia:** Then, go ahead, search for it!! I’m counting on you guys! :yao: 

`Neia left the call`

**Omon:** Goura, you said you were in the study rooms, right? :serio:

**Goura:** Yeah, right! :yao:

**Omon:** Then this mission is for you two...

`Shift to Omon’s perspective`

`Cue elevator music`

Some vehicles are heard in the background making backing up noises, as they move objects in a warehouse.

**Omon:** … I am currently [...] A bit, too far ahead... 😑 

A guy passes nearby driving a lifter vehicle with a heavy metallic box.

**Omon:** ...of the AZD area. :really:

**Goura:** Oooh, it’s alright. We’ll be on it! :yaogo:

**Omon:** Appreciate it. :really:

**Zinda:** Be careful out there Goura, Leyna. :sserio:

**Azar:** Yeah, don’t get decapitated over there, I still need your heads for making fun of. :uwu:

A blunt sound is heard.

**Zinda:** You mean this head? It is still very much attached. 😑 

**Azar:** Ouch!! Could you stop with that! You're gonna give me a brain trauma! :sderp:

**Zinda:** You already have brain trauma. :sserio:

**Goura:** Ooooooh... !! :lmfao:

**Azar:** Hey!! - Even though that's kinda true :yao: - Why you!!?? :derp: 💢

Laughs are heard through the call as Omon brought the palm of his hand to his face.

**Omon:** 🙄 *shakes head* :kbruh:

**Goura:** Will be!! 😂

`Back to Goura’s perspective`

`Call ended`

**Goura:** 🤭 Then, we have nothing to lose, Ley. :malote: Let’s finally meet Keit!! 😼 

**Leyna:** O-Okay! 😂 Let’s go!! 😼 

Leyna and Goura started to get moving.


[7/11/2023 8:18 PM] tastaturzvd
Then the scene changed once more, this time with both Leyna and Goura walking directly in front of the principal’s room. Leyna was extremely nervous, much more than before when she talked to Urza, as she feared she could suffer consequences for doing this act.

**Leyna:** A-are you sure about this, G-Goura? 😅 *I'm shaking*

**Goura:** Hehe, don’t worry. 😅  I don’t think visiting the principal in her room is thaaaat strange of a move either. :yaogo: I mean, normally you would do it at her office, and, whenever she is on schedule for consultation and certainly not after graduation but still. :idea: [...] It is not that bad, we know her already. :yaogo: Or at least it shouldn’t be. :e_e:

**Leyna:** Then… 😞 

She breathed slowly…

**Leyna:** (I will do this for her… ! 😑 )

 …then made an assured expression to encourage herself…

**Leyna:** Let’s get over it! 😾 

And finally, Leyna pushed the ring button of the principal’s room’s door. A bell sound spread across the hallway.

**Leyna and Goura:** *gulp* :e_e: 😓 

A muted voice from behind the door was heard.

**Principal Iwa:** You may enter!!


[7/11/2023 8:24 PM] tastaturzvd
Goura shrugged as he heard the voice, and then entered along with Leyna. Her living room was decorated with lots of lighted up candles spread all across, antique decorations and things that barely anyone at that era would have any knowledge of, as if she was doing a ritual of sorts. Goura was kind of fascinated by all of this, never seeing that side of his principal before, while Leyna just followed behind, nervous as she was.

And soon enough, Master Iwa can be seen at the center of it all, meditating.

**Goura:** E-Excuse us, M-Master Iwa. 😅 

**Principal Iwa:** Yes, children? 😑 

**Goura:** W-wha, m-may I know what you are doing? 😅 

He said, staggering with his words.

**Principal Iwa:** What I am doing right now is a long lost art, founded several hundred years ago, on the long lost Earth by the Buddhists of Tibet. 😑 This is ancestral meditation, a powerful ritual spread across generations, that led to many renowned thinkers to make the great decisions that would lead us to where we are now. 😑 

She swiftly moved her arm and a chopstick moved at incredible speeds towards one of the walls, hitting right on a hanging gong, sticking to it like a magnet from the tip.

[7/11/2023 8:31 PM] tastaturzvd
Then she got up, fixed up her clothing, and then asked:

**Principal Iwa:** What are you two doing here? :sserio:

**Leyna:** Ehm… w-well.. We… you see… :e_e: 😅 

Leyna was beyond nervous, almost sweating at this point, especially after this incredible display.

Goura however managed to gain the enough courage to confess it to her directly.

**Goura:** W-We know that Keit is here. :serio:

The principal lifted her eyebrow, seemingly impressed.

**Principal Iwa:** Oh… so you do? 🧐 Impressive. May I know how you got that information? :sserio:

The principal started walking slowly around the two, with her hands on her back.

**Goura:** Ehm w- 😅 

**Principal Iwa:** A-a-a. *shakes index finger* ☝️  I think I already know. :syaogo: You had your little Orian friend do all the work for you, did you not? *chuckle* 🤭  So very clever. :yaogo:

**Leyna:** H-How. How did you know? :e_e:

**Principal Iwa:** I've heard the alarm. And there are only four people in your group who would be able to pull that off. :sidea:

Mr. Hikami, who wouldn’t bother doing it. 🙄  The Kas Omou girl, who is naturally, currently under my surveillance. :sserio: Ms. Yue, whose morals wouldn't allow her to do such a thing. :sserio: And him, who had manipulated the archive several times for his benefit. :idea: Then I wondered: Who of these fine people, would be more likely the culprit? :yaogo:

**Goura:** Y.. You won’t do anything to him, don’t you? :e_e: [...] Y-You can’t! :e_e:

**Principal Iwa:** Heh! More insightful than I thought! :yaogo: That’s why I wasn’t surprised when you came in. Oh, you would be in soooo, much, trouble; if I wasn’t playing fair, would you not? *chuckle* 🤭 But alas! - ”when you fight by the sword, you die by the sword”. :sserio:


[7/11/2023 8:38 PM] tastaturzvd
**Leyna and Goura:** Phew… *relief* 😮‍💨 

**Leyna:** W-Where have you h-hidden her then? Where is she? 😅 

**Principal Iwa:** Hm… yes, she is all right. She is currently sleeping at my personal office, don’t you worry about her. :yaogo:

**Goura:** But… why? Why hide her like this? What… are you on about? 😧 

**Principal Iwa:** Oh so you do have your questions on what’s happening no? About, the sudden, "reunion", I believe? 😌

**Leyna:** Y-Yeah ehhh… why, why us? :e_e:

**Goura:** Yeah, what is this reunion all about? What is going on with Master Tedu? Why Luria? :e_e: 🤨 

**Principal Iwa:** Then, why don’t you have her explain it all by herself? :yaogo:

The principal creates a panel command and opens up a door in her living room, as she gives them a pass with her arm.

**Leyna:** *surprised* :cwhut:

**Goura:** Is.. she in there? :cwhut: Can we walk in? :e_e:

**Principal Iwa:** *nods* You may go now, if you wish. 😌 As you said well:

 I can't stop you.

`Cue music`

A calm, almost hypnotizing void overwhelmed all perceptible senses. Infinite calmness, infinite peace. A naked but abstract figure can be seen falling. Endlessly falling. A figure of a known two-braided girl.

 "The war…"

A voice resonated in a vast echo. The sound of plasma guns shooting in the background.

"The war against the Norst."

Bombs explode, screeching weasels are heard.

"A nightmare no one ever asked for."

"A war where countless people lost their loved ones, their hopes and their dreams."

"A disaster that forever scarred our memories…"

The war sounds faded out.

Candanz appeared in the void next to the falling body on her knees, holding a piece of clothing, seemingly depressed.

"Candi… how sorry I am for you."

Tedu appeared next, along with an unknown figure facing opposite to him, back to back.

"Master Tedu… I don't really know how you manage to cope with your past."

The figure dematerialized, leaving Tedu alone, making him move his head somberly his downwards, closing his eyes.

Then a cloned image of herself in her Naori outfit appeared.

"Keit… or was it Keithra?"

"It's been so long since I haven't use that name anymore…."

Her image started to distort and shutter.

 "My life was molded by all of it… forged by its merciless might."

"So much it's been deprecated"

Her image faded away in black and white.

Finally, an unexpected figure emerged. A gray hair girl with thick eyebrows, teal eyes, and a juvenile look.

"Lyn… You… You didn't participate in the war, did you?"

**As a distant voice:** Ky... Ky, wake up!

"Why… why are you here? You shouldn’t be here"

**The voice gets closer:** Ky!

`Cue out music`

**KYYY!!**

[...]


[7/11/2023 8:44 PM] tastaturzvd
And suddenly a gasp of air and desk smashing can be heard as Keit suddenly woke up, jumpscaring both Leyna and Goura.

**Keit:** *exalted* :gah:

**Leyna:** AAHHHH!!! :gah:

**Goura:** What the-!?? :cwhut: :loco:

Keit looked a bit disconcerted at first, but then she looked behind her, her eyes started watering.

**Keit:** Lyn? [...] Goura? 😢 

**Leyna:** Hiiii~! :yaogo: 👋

**Goura:** 🤭  *hand on his nape*

**Leyna:** We found ya~! 😁

`Mission state: ACCOMPLISHED!`

**END OF CHAPTER 2**


[3/1/2024 4:48 PM] tastaturzvd
**Chapter 3: Confessions**

`Tedu Kas Omou's office. Xylos Nun, Cintre. NCC Command Center XQL-NY4`

*The scene opened up with Tedu and the principal of Iris Academy, Iwa, having a conversation. The background shows a big window revealing a very advanced city, skyscrapers and vehicles going around left and right.*

*Iwa remained stood-up, serenely looking at the officer with a smug expression in her face, as the pondering Tedu tried to process the information she appeared to just give him.*

**Tedu:** So... what you mean to tell me, is that we could use our political relations with Luria to preserve my relations with Keithra... with a cultural exchange program... :sserio: :really:

**Iwa:** Yes, that would be it. 😌 Refinement School specialization on Lurians seems to be the best bet, they are the hotshot after all. :yaogo:  Some much of a hotshot that you would need to use command authority to call in for a meeting. A notification would be given to the students... nobody has to know of it. Cultural exchange like this has never happened before. We don't want any complaints. :sserio: 

*Tedu narrowed his eyes, unsure about her suggestion.*

**Tedu:** That just... seems too sensitive.  :serio: Do you really think the Command would allow such a thing? :really:

**Iwa:** You don't lose anything with trying~ :syaogo: :malote:

**Tedu:** And you are also aware I generally don't desire to involve myself in the Institute's matters. :really: I've received several offers in the past. I've declined all of them. How am I going justify this change of heart? :serio:

**Iwa:** Ohh... I am aware of that. You don't have to, you are Nep Tedu Kas Omou.:syaogo:

*Iwa began to walk steadily, surrounding the Naori's desk while she speaks in a taunting manner.*

The great commander that tried to get his family into the command, took over a child when your rank is not in duty, gave a hand to an expelled Fort soldier despite her lack of commitment... 😏

**Tedu:** Tsk... 🙄 Where are you going with this? 😒

**Iwa:** All I am saying is, that you shouldn't decline this one when it is served in a silver platter... :sidea: you never have before. :yaogo:  Why stopping now? :malote:

*Tedu sighed at Iwa's convincing argument, acknowledging that his reputation grasped outside of his control*.

**Tedu:** But the issue is... I have abused of my position way too much, for far too long, Iwa. :serio: If I continue the trend, you know what could happen to us... :really:

**Iwa:** Tedu, please. :yaogo:

*Iwa interjected, sitting on his desk.*

**Iwa:**  You know more than me how much these kids need of you and your guidance. :yaogo: Your involvement here is more than justified once it is kickstarted. :sidea: And besides, you do deserve a break from all of this Naori paperwork, now do you? :hehe: I know how tedious it is to be on the high ranks. :yaogo: This will give some of the... amusement... you desire that much in your long, *boring* life. :smalote:

**Tedu:** By making of me... a babysitter... ? 🤨

**Iwa:** Not exactly. 💅 

*She looked at her nails, cleaning them with her thumb.*

**Iwa:** This will take more than just overseeing them and patting their backs every now and then. :yaogo: Luria is a completely different beast! Everything they stand for, everything they do, why they do it. It is all completely different. 😯

Believe when I say, this exchange could be more much insightful, than what you can possibly imagine. 😌


[3/2/2024 10:59 PM] frangipani.
Back in one of the hallways of Wega Academy, a group of nine students was on their way to the principal’s office. Due to everyone else falling behind, Undya found herself at the very front of the group, leading the way involuntarily. Passing several classroom doors that were being closed by teachers about to start today’s lecture, Undya couldn’t help but think to herself…

**Undya thinking:** Those lucky students who can have class as always 😓. Like, what do we even have to go to the principal’s office for? :e_e: And why does that involve all of my friends… and their friends, respectively? :e_e: 😅

Behind her, she heard Barton, Yohan, Yorin and Ovana discuss loudly with one another, apparently about the same questions. Barton made it very clear that he had his own theory about the principal’s order:

**Barton:** Relax y’all, I bet Sayko’s only after me, as always :yaoc:. You guys are probably just being called to give witness statements or something :yaonion:. What could I’ve done this time? No one knows :idea:, but whatever it is, I hope you guys have my back :yaonion::malote:

**Yohan:** Ofc man :lmfao:. I just hope he’s not still mad at you for fucking his son back then :yaonion:

**Barton:** Aw c’mon man :yao:, that Indys guy was hot :idea:, I would have never guessed a guy with those looks could be related to our principal in any way :lmfao: :yaonion:

**Herman:** SHHHH, could you lower your volume?! There are classes beginning right now! 🤫 :really:

Herman hissed warningly, which caused Barton to audibly scoff and roll his eyes.


[3/2/2024 10:59 PM] frangipani.
Herman was right behind them, walking next to Wayra who was scribbling into her notebook. Mihayl and Ilya were the last ones to follow, being amidst a muted but eager conversation as well, the topic of which Undya was unable to hear from her perspective.
Having no one to talk to, Undya started to feel a rare but familiar sensation… loneliness.

**Undya thinking:** I’m the only one walking alone… And neither Herman nor Barton have been looking at me ever since we’ve left the classroom 😟 They must be mad at me… not that I can blame them 😅 … I am a coward after all. I probably deserve feeling like this 😔 😭 Urgh, I hate this day 😣


[3/2/2024 11:59 PM] frangipani.
Only one floor above Undya, another small group with the same destination was about to form. Marina and Tornoda, who had just stepped out of their classroom, were called by a well-known voice.

**Sakar:** Hey! Mari, Noda! 🙋‍♂️ Let’s all go together! :idea: :yaonion:

The two girls noticed Sakar walking towards them with a surprisingly quick pace, followed suit by Sumi and Nayobi. Marina looked relieved to see them.

**Marina:** Oh, hey guys! Great timing! Where’s the principal’s office again? 😅

**Sakar:**  Ground floor :idea: 😓

He replied in a hectic voice.

As the group of five stepped on the stairway, Tornoda decided to not leave Sakar’s fast pace uncommented:

**Tornoda:** You do know that Principal Sayko told us to _go_ to his office, not to _run_ there? :ureally: You’re stressing me out with how much you’re rushing 🙄

**Sakar:** Sorry 😅, it’s just that I’m really nervous :yaogo:. Why would Principal Sayko want all of us to come to his office? Have we done anything wrong? 😅 He never calls us in there for any positive reason :yaonion:

**Nayobi:** *chuckles* Who knows, maybe he overheard my joke about me making Sakar kill some people for me, and took it seriously? :yao: :malote: Wouldn’t be the first time for someone to take my sarcasm seriously :malote: :yaonion:

**Tornoda:** You mean, like Sumi does all the time? :malote:

She added, side-eyeing Sumi with a mischievous smile. Sumi gasped and almost responded, but then quickly stopped herself from countering and turned away, blushing.


[3/3/2024 12:01 AM] frangipani.
Luckily for Sumi, Marina took pity on the poor girl.

**Marina:** Don’t worry, Sumi, it’s nothing personal :yaogo: :upatpat:. I bet those two are secretly jealous of the pure soul you have 😉

**Sumi:** Eh, yeah, probably, hehe 😅 :e_e:

Sakar, who now seemed even more anxious than before, intercepted.

**Sakar:** Guys, be serious please :yaonion:, what do you think it could be? :e_e:

**Tornoda:** Oh, I think I know what it’s gonna be 😌

**Sakar:** Really? :e_e:

**Tornoda:** Uh-huh 😇 I would have told you guys before class if any of you had listened 😅, but well, guess I’m telling you now 🤨 

Tornoda replied with a small sigh. She quickly unlocked her phone’s screen and opened the news app on her phone. After searching for and finding a specific article, she stopped walking in the middle of the stairs, which, in turn, brought her friends, who were filled with curiosity, to a halt as well. Then she held her phone screen towards the others, revealing the headline of the article.

**Tornoda:** This. 😇 

The group gasped.

**Marina:** *reads* “WEGA ACADEMY CHOSEN FOR NEW PROJECT WITH THE NAORI COMMAND”? 🧐

**Sumi:** What does that mean? 😅

**Tornoda:** Isn’t it obvious? :syaoc: A brand-new exchange program between our school and some students from the Naori Command. 👀

**Nayobi:** Wait, what? 😳 Are you implying we might be… :gasp:

**Sakar:** …the exchange students for the Naoris? 😱 🤩


[5/3/2024 10:31 PM] frangipani.
Inside the principal's office downstairs, Principal Sayko was sitting at his desk, staring blankly to a random corner of the room. Opposing his desk stood two rows of chairs made out of a plastic-like material. Indys was sitting on one of them, looking at his father with a similarly expressionless face. Silence stood between them, only casually disrupted by the loud rhythmic ticking of a clock on the wall.

Indys cleared his throat.

**Indys:** Ahem 😮‍💨... dad? 😅

The principal looked at him with raised eyebrows.

**Principal Sayko:** Yes, Indys? 👀 🤨 

Indys leaned back on his chair with a pensive expression on his face.

**Indys:** The other students 😅... do you think they will all agree? 🤔

The principal took a deep breath.

**Principal Sayko:** 😮‍💨 Well, it is better to calculate for the worst outcome :serio:. On one hand, I know that plenty of the students have shown an interest in the Naori Command. Like Herman Paul, the boy who wrote that incredible essay about the possible technological future of the Cintrean-Lurian alliance, he will definitely agree to partake :idea:. And our school's most ambitious reporter, Wayra Taron, is among them too, I am not worried about her either :yaoc:. But then there are others in this group who seem afraid of the unknown or are easily overwhelmed... it is possible that those might not agree out of fear. :serio: However, the ones that worry me the most are those who overestimate themselves, who believe they can get away with everything 😒. I took them in because of group cohesion and diversity, but who knows what happens if they get access to another rooftop... 🙄


[5/3/2024 10:32 PM] frangipani.
He frowned, clearly having a particular student in mind.

**Indys:** Huh :serio:. Is that why you are scared? 🧐 😟

He asked, tilting his head.

The principal flinched at the mentioning of the word "scared", and then replied with a voice that sounded almost offended:

**Principal Sayko:** I'm not at all sc- 🤨 Ah, never mind :yaonion:. Sorry, son, I am not used to people calling out my emotions at work 😅. It's just that this project is... unpredictable 😮‍💨. This could either go excellent, or - if it doesn't - ruin the reputation of my school :serio:

**Indys:** Dad. ☺️ 

Indys leaned forward in the chair and gently put his hand on his father's arm.

**Indys:** Relax. It's all gonna be fine. 😌 I will keep an eye on those troublemakers for you, I promise 😉

The principal gave his son a grateful smile.

**Principal Sayko:** Thanks. ☺️

And then the office door opened.


[5/3/2024 11:27 PM] frangipani.
Undya took a moment to recognize the familiar face sitting opposed to the principal. Barton, however, knew much faster.

**Barton:** Hey Prince Psycho, what did you call me fo- :idea: --- 😳 oh shit 🙊

He stopped as his glance fell upon Indys, and his face turned bright red.

**Indys:** Hi, Barton. Good to see you 😇. Next time, please use that method called "knocking on the door" before you enter. It is only fair to alert people instead of surprising them unpleasantly, don't you agree? 😇

**Barton:** I-I-.... :e_e::yaonion:

He stammered while Indys smiled confidently, and for a brief moment, even the principal couldn't help but raise his eyebrows at his son's sudden passive-aggressive demeanor. Undya heard some whispers behind her.

**Mihayl:** *whispers* They haven't talked ever since Barton had ghosted him :idea: 🤭

**Ilya:** *whispers annoyedly* Just like he did with me? Ugh, when does he _learn_?! 😒

The students filled the room, most of them having confused looks on their faces. Why were only half of them there yet? What was the principal's son doing here? And most importantly, what did the principal want?


[5/3/2024 11:27 PM] frangipani.
Undya slowly walked to the first row and sat down to Indys's left, feeling some sort of pity for him as most of the others sat down in the second row, especially Barton who took the furthest seat away from him. The only ones who dared to sit in the front row as well were Wayra, who sat down to the principal's son's right and inspected him with a curious glance, and Herman, reserving a seat between him and Undya, presumably for Nayobi. This reminded Undya again that Indys was not the only one being avoided.

**Undya thinking:** So he _is_ still mad at me :e_e: 😔. I just hope Mari, Sakar and the rest of the gang are gonna arrive soon 😅:yaonion:

The principal counted the group of students in under one second, then raised his voice to silence the second row:

**Principal Sayko:** May I please have your attention, dear students? :serio: Do you know where the rest of you is? :serio:

Some students shrugged and shook their heads.

**Herman:** They were in other classrooms, thus they might be late :idea:

**Principal Sayko:** I hope they will appear soon, because I have a tight schedule to get through, and this message concerns all of you 😮‍💨 :serio:.

**Wayra:** Ooooh, what message? 🤩 :malote:

Wayra asked, opening her notebook in anticipation.

**Principal Sayko:** Please have patience, Wayra :serio:. I would like to make this announcement as soon as everyone has g-


[5/3/2024 11:27 PM] frangipani.
The door swung open again, and Sakar's silhouette appeared in the door frame, breathing heavily.

**Sakar:** Principal Sayko 😮‍💨 😮‍💨... are we going... 😮‍💨 :e_e:... to do the exchange program with the Naoris??? :loco: :e_e: 😮‍💨

Everyone gasped.

**Some students:** Exchange??? :e_e:

**Other students:** The NAORIS?!?!?! :e_e: 😱

**Indys:** 🙄 why can't students at this school knock before entering?! 🤦‍♂️


[5/4/2024 1:57 PM] frangipani.
The principal seemed surprisingly amused at Sakar's sudden interruption, unlike the other students, who looked at each other in irritation.

**Principal Sayko:** Please calm yourself, Sakar, and take a seat :yaogo: :serio:

Sakar nodded, then walked to the front row while catching his breath. Judging from that and his strong body odour, Undya guessed that he must have been sprinting to the principal's office. He gave Undya a small smile as a greeting, then made the surprisingly thoughtful choice to sit down as far away from the others as possible.

**Undya thinking:** Poor Sakar, even he seems to notice his own smell :e_e:

Then, the four missing students appeared in the doorframe. Nayobi instantly looked out for her boyfriend, and, after having found him, went to sit down between Herman and Undya. Sumi, Marina and Tornoda followed suit and sat down on the three remaining seats close to Sakar. Tornoda shot Sakar a suspicious glance. 

Nayobi greeted Herman with a kiss on the cheek, then turned towards Undya.

**Nayobi:** Hello there :malote:

She greeted, imitating her boyfriend's catchphrase.

**Undya:** Hi ☺️

**Undya thinking:** Finally, someone from the gang is talking to me :yaonion:

**Nayobi:** *leans towards Undya and whispers* Did anything happen in here before we arrived? :e_e: The emotional atmosphere in this room is super weird :sus:. Even Herman seems to be more... bitter than usual :e_e:

**Undya:** Eh, hehe... several things happened, actually 😅, I can tell you later in a more private setting :e_e:


[5/4/2024 6:00 PM] frangipani.
Their conversation, like the other conversations that had started in this room, were cut short by Principal Sayko.

**Principal Sayko:** Ahem :serio: :ureally:. Now that all of you have found your way to my office, I can explain why I called all of you here to begin with :serio:. You may have already noticed the additional student in my office, whom some of you already are familiar with. :serio:

He looked at Barton, Yohan, Ovana, and Mihayl in particular. Those, he knew, were for sure familiar with his son... in one way or the other.

**Principal Sayko:** He is my son Indys :idea:, and you may wonder why he is among you. :maybe:

**Barton:** Yeah, why is he among us? :yao::e_e:

**Indys:** *looks sussy at Barton*:sus:

**Barton:** *looks sussy back at Indys*:sus:

**Principal Sayko:** I will get to that in a bit. :ureally: Anyway, the reason why I have called you here is that I am asking you for your collaboration... on a project of the Cintrean-Lurian Alliance. :serio: The Naori Command has asked Wega Academy to cooperate on an exchange program with the Utam Institute, which is a very prestigious Cintrean institution. :idea: After having evaluated the students of Pre-Graduation Year according to social and intellectual prowess, cultural openness, and exceptional Talent control, I have selected the fifteen of you as viable participants for the exchange. :serio:

Many students gasped again, Undya being among them.

**Undya thinking:** A school exchange... with Cintreans? 😳


[5/4/2024 6:01 PM] frangipani.
For a brief moment, her parents' heated discussion with her brother flashed back into her mind. Her father's face, red with fury. Her mother's features, pale with worry. Dynlak unable to control his Talent. Yelling back at his father. His chair crashing onto the ground.

**Undya thinking:** They are not going to like these news... :e_e:

The other students suddenly seemed agitated, except for Indys who calmly sat on his chair and nodded slowly as the chaos around him started to unfold.

**Sakar:** So it was true!! 😱  Noda, you genius!! You knew!! :yaonion:

**Tornoda:** Dude, don't thank me, thank the article that is ALL OVER TODAY'S NEWS. :ureally:

**Herman:** It is in the news today? :e_e: Why have I not heard? :loco::yaonion:

**Wayra:** So it's true what Sakar said? We are going to meet Naori students??? 😱 🤩

Wayra asked the principal, her eyes gleaming with excitement. Her pen was hovering over her notebook, as if it was ready to write pages upon pages of notes. The principal, however, made an unsure hand gesture.

**Principal Sayko:** Hmmm 🤨, not all of them are technically Naoris, but they are all Cintreans, from what I have heard :idea:

**Wayra:** Really?? 🤩 How cool!! This has potential for the best article this school has ever seen!! :malote::yaonion:


[5/4/2024 6:01 PM] frangipani.
Several other students started bombarding the principal with questions as well.

**Yohan:** Are the Cintrean students our age? :idea:🤔

**Barton:** Are there any hotties among them?? :malote:

**Herman:** Does our grade's level of knowledge and emotional maturity even suffice in order to not leave a species as rational-minded as the Cintreans disappointed of both our state's education system and our teenagers' lack of control of their hormones??? :serio:

**Mihayl** And why is Indys here again???? Is this a case of nepotism????? :yao::sus: (No offence, bro :yaonion::malote:)

**Principal Sayko:** SILENCE!!!! 😡🗯️

The principal yelled, startling everyone including his son and Undya. Then the principal caught his composure again.

**Principal Sayko:** Ahem, I meant, please cease your questions until the explanation is finished. :serio: In fact, my highly-esteemed colleague from the Naori Command, Nep Tedu Kas Omou, is going to give you further insight into the program :idea:. Please pay attention as I am only going to show this holographic recording once. :serio:


[5/4/2024 6:01 PM] frangipani.
**Undya thinking:** Holographic recording? :e_e:

The principal reached behind a stack of paper documents and summoned a small blue crystal in a rhomboid shape, which clearly wasn't from Luria, as it started floating on top of the principal's hand. Under the open-mouth stares of his audience, he touched the crystal and placed it at the very front of his desk, facing the students. There, it slowly started to disintegrate, and the crystallic dust quickly rearranged itself like a piece of art being formed by a Constructor. In a matter of seconds, the formerly dense rhomboid crystal dust had taken the shape of a man with striking light-blue eyes. The students looked dumbfounded as most of them had never seen this technology in real life before, many of them making fascinated sounds like "oh", "ah", and "wow" at the sight of this piece of basic Cintrean technology.

And then the crystalline image of Tedu Kas Omou started to speak.


[5/5/2024 2:53 PM] tastaturzvd
**Tedu:** Greetings, students of Wega Academy. :serio: 

My name is Tedu Kas Omou. I am the second highest ranking foreign affairs officer of the Naori Command, a governmental scientific organization that plays a crucial role in the inner workings of the Cintrean Interstellar Meritocracy. 

As Mr. Sayko may have already informed you... 

*Tedu opened his hand, extending it towards the students. A visual representation of planet Luria and planet Cintre, orbiting around each other like the Ying and Yang, appeared on top of his palm, in a symbiotic dance.*

 ...you've been selected to form part of a special cultural exchange program, the first of its kind to ever be conducted on Equian territory, one which could proof to be a symbol of trust, companionship and solidarity for both Cintreans and Lurians. :serio:

*Fireworks are fired on the atmosphere of both planets. As soon as they stopped, Tedu condensed the image in a tiny seed as he clenched his fist, and then threw it towards the floor, making it grow bigger, this time showing a visual representation of Wega Academy.*

**Tedu:** If you agree to sign up, 15 students from the Utam High Institute of Education, coming from very different cultural and professional backgrounds, will come to your school's facilities. :serio:

*15 profile silhouettes representing the Utam students popped up on top of the academy, with a blue frame.*

They will be appointed like any other exchange student, they will wear Lurian clothes, and study what you study. :idea:

*The simulation showed the 15 students, coloured in blue, walking in using Lurian attire to the entrance of the academy.*

Be that as it may, your involvement would come in the form of guidance and teamwork. :serio:

*Another 15 pictures with a red contour, this time representing Wega Academy students, appeared on top of the academy.*

You would each be paired to one student of my students, and your duty would be to attempt your very best to help them fulfil their role as a Wega Academy undergraduate. :serio:

*The profile pictures randomly matched up with the silhouettes, highlighting the bond between them.*

*Then the walls of the academy became transparent, as it was seen how the different red coloured students are helping the blue coloured ones: In class, on the cafeteria talking to them, and a variety of other activities.*

It is expected of them to receive the full experience of forming part of the Equian community, and of you to be receptive of their differences, so please, cooperate with them. Let the cultural exchange flourish... do everything you can to give them a fair welcome to your country. :serio:

*Finally, the simulation dissipated, like dust being blown by the wind.*


[5/5/2024 3:17 PM] tastaturzvd
**Tedu:** As for the compensation: 😑 

*Tedu grabbed his Naori weapon and steadily but firmly hit the ground with it, standing tall and with his back poised in a straight line. His voice resounded on the room with imponence.*

**Tedu:** The satisfactory involvement on this exchange means, **the absolute support of the Meritocracy to the future affairs of all students involved!!** :serio:

This not only would boost all your opportunities regarding future employability, but it will be akin to a high level scholarship. **We will sponsor you!** You may give suggestions to further deepen our bond, taking into account both Lurian and Cintrean society alike, they will be carefully considered by the Command. :serio:

*Tedu then deviated his gaze, indicating a level of compassion, with a faint hint of guilt in his voice.*

I know this offer may feel sudden to some of you, especially given that Luria is still adjusting to out of bounds involvement, but this decision was made like this for a reason. 😕 

`Flashback:`

*A quick faintly saturated image of Tedu talking with Principal Iwa in his office appeared. His voice sounded full of echo, distant and ephimeral.*

*Tedu, with a confused and unsure face, scans his eyes fast through a series of scripts in a crystal panel.*

The spontaneous nature of this program goes to show the high complexity of Lurian-Cintrean relationships. Carrying it out under a series of agreements carefully set to guarantee maximum security and reciprocity, is not an easy task. 😑

*Principal Iwa's confident smug was shown on the other side, in contrast to his.*

 Moreover, an exchange such as this has been long suggested, but consensus regarding these agreements was not able to be met. Until recently, that I got reminded of it, and took the offer to finally put it into motion. 😓 

*Tedu sighing, seemingly unconvinced, proceeded to scan his four right hand fingers on it.*

`End of flashback.`

**Tedu:** But in spite of all of this, the future of this program still falls on your hands, students. Only if you sign in as a collective, will the project be able to come forth as it is. :serio: 

*Tedu saved his weapon, and with an outwards movement of both his hands, summoned a big crystalline platform in front him.*

Please, place your right hand on this table if you agree to participate. I will forever thank you for your participation, if you end up deciding in its favour. :serio:

The choice, is yours to make. 😑


[5/6/2024 9:44 PM] frangipani.
Tedu's projection then stayed in place with a look of anticipation in his eyes. During the following seconds of absolute silence, Principal Sayko took a long look at the speechless students in front of him. 

He couldn't help but smile to himself. For the first time in his career, some of the loudest and most daring students were completely quiet. 

And there was his son, staring in awe at the projection of Tedu. The principal felt a warm sensation arise in his chest.

**Principal Sayko thinking:** Indys looks so excited 👀. Yes... it was the right decision to give him this opportunity ☺️. I... just hope the other students won't ruin this for him 😅

He then loudly cleared his throat, in order to redirect the students' attention onto him.

**Principal Sayko:** A-hem!! :serio: Thank you very much for your highly informative and immersive presentation, Mr. Kas Omou! :idea: :serio: Students, do you have any questions? :serio:

Several hands shot up at once.

**Principal Sayko thinking:** This reaction implies great interest :maybe: :excelente:. But if I want it to stay this way, I should be strategical about the upcoming "Q&A session", as Indys would call it. :maybe: Hmmm... 🤔

He quickly scanned the students' mind for their level of knowledge, as well as their facial expressions for their level of excitement.

**Principal Sayko thinking:** I guess I should allow an excited student with only basic knowledge to speak first, in order to gradually dismantle any sceptics, both emotionally and intellectually. :maybe:  Like... Ilya 👀. I didn't expect this girl of all people to be genuinely interested in this exchange :e_e:

**Principal Sayko:** First question: Ilya. :serio:

**Ilya:** I actually only have one question 😅: Will the exchange students be staying at our homes? 😏


[5/6/2024 9:59 PM] tastaturzvd
*Tedu's projection appeared to think for a moment, narrowing its eyes, as if it was processing the question just asked of it.*

**Tedu:** Regarding residency, the exchange students will have a cintrean hovering residency pot, set in the nearest cintrean residency center to the academy, with their own personal chambers. As per the rules of confidentiality and security stated on our treaty, the apartments will be overwatched by cintrean police enforcement, but remain private.

 However, due to current civilian rights agreed upon by the alliance, the students can get involved in trips outside of their intended locations, so long as they report it in due. This means that they can be invited to form part of outdoor activities, including visiting or even staying at someone's house, if it is needed of them, or if it doesn't threaten their immediate security. :serio:


[5/6/2024 10:13 PM] frangipani.
The students gasped loudly.

**Undya thinking:** Did the hologram just... 😳 🫢

**Ilya:** OMG!! HE REPLIED!!! 🫣😱

She shrieked, provoking attention from Barton.

**Barton:** Yeah, you sounded just like that whenever I texted you back then :yao::malote:

**Ilya:** Barton, what the fuck?!?!? :e_e: Don't make this weird?!! :mface:

**Barton:** Why am I the one making it weird? :yao: I know why you asked that question :malote:

**Ilya:** Shut up! It's not like you didn't have the same thought :mface:

**Barton:** 🤭 :malote:

**Herman:** *murmurs under his breath* At least he is focusing on his other ex now :really:

**Nayobi:** Sorry, what was that, darling? 👀

**Herman:** Nothing, love :really:. *to the principal* Mr. Sayko, may I pose the next question? :idea:

**Principal Sayko:** Go ahead, Herman :serio:

**Principal Sayko thinking:** The best student of the year showing interest and proactivity? Excellent :excelente:

**Herman:** *to Tedu's projection* Mr. Kas Omou, I greatly thank you for your demonstration of the current Cintrean technology. :serio: But may you do us the honor of elaborating on how you manage to respond to our questions? :serio: Are you a projection of the real Mr. Kas Omou responding in real time? Or are you an artificial intelligence? Or simply a collection of pre-recorded answers to a fitting estimate of what our questions would be? :serio:


[5/6/2024 10:24 PM] tastaturzvd
*The hologram once again stood in place, seemingly pondering about the question before carefully answering. *

**Tedu:** This hologram is an interactive recording and projecting device that uses information regarding both Nep Kas Omou's registry, his notes on this matter, and up to date instances about the situation at hand to reply to given questions. 

What you saw at the beginning was of his own doing, however, what you are viewing right now is an advanced simulation of what he might reply given all the information available in the Great Link Network of him. This approach is often used by high ranking officials to personalize responses and preserve effectiveness in communication, due to their tight schedules. :serio:


[5/6/2024 10:33 PM] frangipani.
**Herman:** I see, it appears to be a more evolved version of artificial intelligence 👀. Quite intriguing :maybe:

He replied, nodding slowly. Meanwhile, Principal Sayko was already focusing on the next student.

**Principal Sayko:** Marina, please. :serio:

**Marina:** Are the matches between each Cintrean and Lurian student pair randomized, as shown in the presentation? 🙋‍♀️:syaogo: Or are there any matching criteria, like same gender, similar interests, and such? :kthinking:


[5/6/2024 10:45 PM] tastaturzvd
**Tedu:** How the matching is done is a confidential matter that is only discussed by the those in charge of the exchange program. However, you can expect some level of tinkering when it comes to the grouping, since factors such as performance and modus operandi are likely to be taken into account to some extent. :serio:


[5/6/2024 10:51 PM] frangipani.
**Marina:** Oh, I see 😯, thank you for your answer then, and sorry if my question was indiscrete 😅

Before Principal Sayko could say anything, Wayra brought up the next question:

**Wayra:** Mr. Kas Omou, you said something about a sponsorship as a reward 👀, how exactly would that sponsorship work? Can you tell us more on what it would do for us regarding our careers? 🤩

**Principal Sayko thinking:** I usually don't like being interrupted like this 😑, but that question is... excellent :excelente:


[5/6/2024 11:11 PM] tastaturzvd
**Tedu:** The sponsorship given to the students will include a direct support from the Cintrean Ministry of Education, the Utam Institute, and the Naori Command. The reason for this is due to the nature of the exchange, which will involve the professionalization of all students involved in both Cintrean and Lurian matters. 

How is this possible, you may ask? :serio:

Well, cintrean education goes around in three levels. Basis, Synthesis and Refinement. Students at the stage of refinement are expected to bring their skills to good use, to potentially put them into practice for their intended laboring exit. 

This exchange, is meant to work as a transition for cintrean refinement school undergraduates to the Lurian way of living, and to introduce you, as the mediators, to our own culture and opportunities. :serio:

If the program proves to be successful, you will be receiving full support from us, since we would have assessed your willingness to participate to the cintrean cause. This assessment and your cooperation with the students will prove not only that you are up to cintrean standards, but you are compatible with the ways in which we want to promote our alliance. 

This is enough for us to justify giving you a pass, one that most Lurian authorities and corporations will recognize as someone very well worth considering. You would even be given a free pass to enter Cintrean education to join us if you so desire. 

That being said, it is important you remain genuine with the students. After all, we are seeking to see the results of both cultures clashing and interacting with each other. You are free to do or offer what you think is normal to you, according to your own upbringing. 

This exchange is about exploration, and about seeing the true faces of each other's cultures. :serio:


[5/6/2024 11:38 PM] frangipani.
**Wayra:** Full support in my career? 😱 

**Wayra thinking:** And become the best reporter of the entire multiverse?!?! 🤩

**Indys:** Enter Cintrean education?? 😳 

**Indys thinking:** And maybe find the right career for me after all?!?! 😍

**Barton:** Remain genuine??? 🫢

**Barton thinking:** And get to try out Seduction on Cintreans?!?! :malote:

**Wayra, Indys and Barton:** Amazing!!! :loco: 🤩:yaonion:

**Principal Sayko:** :excelente:

Sakar, who was almost sitting closest to the projection, leaned forward towards it and asked carefully:

**Sakar:** Ehm, Mr. Kasimir... :idea:

**Sumi:** *whispers* Kas Omou 🤫

Sitting next to him, Sumi corrected him.

**Sakar:** Kas Omou, sorry :yaogo: :yaonion:, I have a question as well :idea:: What do the students from U-turn Institute-

**Sumi:** *whispers* It's Utam :sidea: 🙄

**Sakar:** *in a lowered but still audible voice* Don't roll your eyes, Sumi-chan, you know I'm not good with names :yao::derp:, *in normal volume* anyway :idea:, what do your students know about us? How are their questions answered if their teacher is with us right now? 🤔 Do they, in turn, have a hologram of Principal Sayko answering their questions? :idea:

The students erupted in laughter, and even the principal himself chuckled at the thought of this absurd idea.

**Herman:** Did you not listen to how it works... 🤦‍♂️:derp:

**Barton:** HAHAHA!!! :jajaja: Dude, you're stealing my thunder today! :yao::yaonion:

Even Undya, who had tried her best to stay under everyone's radar since the presentation, couldn't help but give Sakar a thumbs up.

**Undya thinking:** So creative 😂, no wonder he's my bestie 🤭


[5/6/2024 11:50 PM] tastaturzvd
**Tedu:** The only information that the students can access is that of which is given to them to study, meaning that they know little to no information about you. This will be a blindfold experience to most of them. :serio: 

*Image of Keit studying the webpage of Wega Academy on Principal Iwa's room and subsequently Neia's group shrugging their shoulders to the offer they received.*

And no, they won't have a projection telling them about the program, they have an appointed meeting with my subordinate Candanz Korr, which will be the one telling them the details about it personally. :serio:

*Image of the invitation that Sathki received about the meeting.*


[5/7/2024 12:17 AM] frangipani.
**Herman:** So they hear all about it in a one-on-one setting? How curious 🤔:serio:

The students looked at each other in excitement and anticipation. They continued posing several more questions, and Tedu resumed answering each of them in absolute diligence.

Yes, they all seemed happy about this chance. And most of them actually were.
Except for...

**Undya thinking:** Me. 😣 

Undya was smiling on the outside, yes. But the inside didn't match the picture.
On the inside she felt lost and confused.

It was not because she didn't want to do the exchange.
No, quite the opposite.
It was because she _wanted_ to do it. She _wanted_ to meet more kind-hearted and interesting people like Mari, make more friendships like her current friend group - except half of them was mad at her rn -, and maybe even make some connections that Dynlak could use for his band's success.


[5/7/2024 12:17 AM] frangipani.
Her parents, however, would rip her head off, and cause an argument that could end up even bigger than the one she had witnessed this morning. Because this would hit her parents much harder.
It was one thing for rebellious Dynlak to cause trouble, but Undya, sweet agreeable Undya...

A flashback appeared showing Undya's childhood self, a little girl with long hair dressed in bright colors, smiling at her parents' praise. Then the flashback showed her parents' happy faces while looking at their well-behaved daughter.

**Undya thinking:** Mom... dad 😢... if I do this... can I still be your little girl? 😖

**Nayobi:** Hey, are you okay? 😟🖤

**Undya:** H-huh? :e_e:

**Nayobi:** Your blocking has some cracks in it :e_e:, I can see your emotions through them. Just warning ya :yaogo:

**Undya:** Gah!!! :gah: I... I still have some questions about this offer, that's all 😅:yaonion:

**Nayobi:** That's quite a euphemism 🤨. But don't worry,  you're not the only one in this room whom I am sensing a skeptical vibe from :sus: 

**Undya thinking:** Who could that be? :e_e:

In the back row, a hand shot up.

**Mihayl:** Mr Sayko, all of this sounds too good to be true :maybe:... where is the catch? 🧐 And why is your son involved? 😅


[5/13/2024 9:54 PM] frangipani.
**Principal Sayko:** E-eh? :e_e:

The principal stammered, startled by those sudden doubts. A zardonic smile rushed over Mihayl's face as he began to elaborate.

**Mihayl:** Sure, this all sounds great and awesome and yada yada :yao:, but we don't know if there are any ulterior motives that those two are not telling us :maybe:. There are plenty of things we don't know about the Cintreans, so they might be trying to recruit us to their workforce. Or trick us into trusting them or something. :really: Whatever it is, it seems to favor nepotism. I read the newspaper article while that hologram was talking, and he seems to have his daughter on board for the exchange. No wonder Mr. Sayko brought... his son along with him as well. :really: Didn't expect you to become a nepo baby, Indys, I'm kinda disappointed. :really:

**Undya thinking:** Wow... that sounds so much like my Dad :e_e:... but meaner. Poor Indys :T_T:

Indys, however, chose to be proactive in this moment, and turned around to face Mihayl, unamused.

**Indys:** Listen, dude, I can feel your doubts, and based on all the things even a Seeker like you doesn't know about the Naoris, those doubts are completely valid :serio:. It is good that you dare pose a question no one else would have asked, and I respect you for that. :serio: What I dislike about your assumptions, though, is the tone. :serio: You are acting as if the principal and Nep Kas Omou were trying to lure us into a trap, when in fact, they did everything in their power to make it as beneficial to _all_ of us as possible, in order to prepare this exchange. I have witnessed his efforts even at home :idea:. So you don't have to worry, there is no catch and everything is safe. :serio:


[5/13/2024 9:55 PM] frangipani.
He then lowered his voice and looked Mihayl dead in the eye.

**Indys:** And about the accusation of nepotism... _you_, of all people, shouldn't judge anyone for using connections to achieve your goals. :really:

Mihayl gasped with open eyes, feeling insulted at Indys's mild implication which half the room didn't even understand.

**Herman:** *murmurs* Fantastic... this appears to devolve into a conflict like mine and Barton's all over again... 😑

**Nayobi:** Huh? A conflict? :e_e:

Wanting to keep the peace between the two lovers, Undya quickly tried to intercept.

**Undya:** A-and what did he mean by Mihayl using connections? 😅

Herman raised an eyebrow at her, and replied with an annoyance which made Undya instantly regret that decision.

**Herman:** Is it not obvious? :really: Mihayl sees people solely as a means to an end, as a way to please his fragile sense of self. He liked to step on me when I was his best friend just to feel better about himself, and concerning Indys, he even went one step further than Barton: Poor Indys was merely a tool for homosexual experience to him. :really: Moreover, it is weird that you asked, Undya. I can see that you already knew the answer to your own question. 🤨


[5/13/2024 9:55 PM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Hehehe 😅:yaonion:

Feeling called out, Undya quickly turned her gaze back to Mihayl and Indys who were eyeing each other angrily at close range.

**Mihayl:** Did you just insult me??? :really: 😡

**Indys:** What gave it away? My condescending _tone_, huh? :really:

**Wayra:** You two look like you're gonna kiss any minute now. Just like Barton and Herman earlier. 🤭:malote:

**Mihayl and Indys:** WHAT?!! 😳 Ew!! :loco:

**Ilya:** Wayra, for real: _what the fuck_?!?!? :sderp::ureally:

**Nayobi:**_to Herman_ You kissed Barton???? 😱 :T_T:

**Herman and Barton:**  WHAT?!! 😳 Ew!! :loco:

**Undya:** No, no, they just had a conflict 😅

**Nayobi:** A conflict? Wha- :e_e:

**Principal Sayko:** STUDENTS!!! :loco:💢 You are wasting both my and your own time with such petty discussions! 😠 To put it simply, there is no downside to this project that I am aware of. 😮‍💨 As my son explained truthfully, both I and Mr. Kas Omou have outdone ourselves with this offer. And while it is the duty of a Knowledge Seeker to question what is in front of their very eyes, I can assure you, no, _promise_ you, that, to my knowledge, there is no catch or "hidden agenda". :serio: If you want, we can ask Mr. Kas Omou himself :idea:. Mr. Kas Omou, please forgive this strange question, but... are there any potential negative consequences for the students in case they take up the offer? :serio:

He asked, looking at the hologram with a hint of desperation.


[5/13/2024 10:27 PM] tastaturzvd
*The hologram remained static and non-reactive, with its eyes shut in a frozen idle position, holding its projected weapon close to its chest.*


[5/13/2024 10:32 PM] frangipani.
**Sakar:**... is he still thinking? :e_e:

**Sumi:** I think it... broke 😟

**Barton:** Great job, Mihayl, your doubts ruined the chances for everyone else! :really: :derp:

**Mihayl:** Hrmph. :mface:


[5/13/2024 11:13 PM] tastaturzvd
*The hologram then began speaking, catching their attention once more. This time with a more serious and upfront attitude.*

**Tedu:** I am afraid there is a misunderstanding here. While it is not far fetched for you to assume Keithra Kas Omou to be Nep Kas Omou's daughter, I am afraid to inform you that surnames on Cintrean grounds are given on different terms compared to those Lurian. 

*A silhouette of a man facing front in a cintrean Naori cloak is seen looking at a snowy exterior from the high tech chamber he is in.*

Keithra, while under Tedu's mentorship for several years, was just appointed as a long time student of his, her real father is the prestigious scientist and researcher Uzom Vylie, former Command representative that was found no longer suitable to assess her education. :serio:

*A flashing image of all members of Keit's group appeared on screen one by one.*

Keithra's group was chosen from the rest as an election from the Nep due to its great variety of students from different parts of the Cintrean Meritocracy and their variety in skills, not necessarily due to their preformance...

*Scene back at the cafeteria with Omon and Leyna:*

**Leyna:** Like, I get it, that planet is the hotshot and all, but really? :yao: Why us of all people!? :huuh: 

...some of these students come from beyond the Cintrean spatial territory. Keithra's group is specially suited for this exchange.

*Quick flash to Urza, Iluia and Hemo.*

While it is indeed possible for Kas Omou to choose this approach to test his student, bare in mind that none of this comes in his nor her benefit. Regular Cintrean education would have proven to be better for her in the long run, as this project puts his and his student's reputation on the line. 

*Xicaru, very emotionally troubled, shouting at Zinda and Azar appeared for a few seconds:*

**Xicaru:** There is NO WAY he would agree to something as ridiculous as that on his own!!  😠 💢

She is coming from a prestigious mentorship line after all.

The choice of doing this for her own sake would no only be irresponsible, but come across as detrimental to her.

*An scene of Tedu looking down after having argued with Keithra, at a small plushie made of carefully sewed fibres, seemingly handcrafted. It seemed to be shaped after him.*

 It doesn't offer any real advantage... 

*He proceed to squish it forcefully.*

within the meritocracy whatsoever. 😑


[5/16/2024 11:28 PM] frangipani.
The scene switched back to the Lurian students, most of them surprised at the revelation of Keit not being Tedu's biological daughter.

**Mihayl:** Huh? 🐱

**Barton:** I didn't get it either. But I think she's adopted or sth :yaoc:

**Mihayl:** Ah 👀. So the only one committing actual nepotism is our principal 🤭

Herman, of course, wasn't surprised upon learning this.

**Herman:** Ah. This makes me recall an article I have read about Cintrean family life. It explained that for Cintreans, "family" has a different meaning than for Lurians. :serio:

**Barton:** Wow, "a different meaning", what a deep revelation :yao:

**Herman:** Grrr... :mface:

**Undya:** Eh, I think I read that article as well, hehe 😅... didn't they have, like, an emphasis on family of choice? :e_e:

Undya quickly intervened, despite being uncomfortable with posing another question to Herman - who, in this case, seemed neutral about the interruption.

**Nayobi:** Relatable. Bio families can suck sometimes 🤭


[5/16/2024 11:28 PM] frangipani.
Nayobi commented with a stiff chuckle. She was obviously trying her best to hide the hurt behind that statement, but not quite succeeding.

**Herman:** One could call it a family of choice. However, in most cases, it is not a choice the family members make themselves, but rather a choice that is made for them in order to suit their career, if I recall correctly. :idea: In the case of Mr. Kas Omou, though, it seems to be rather different. His daughter might not be blood-related to him, but it will be interesting to draw parallels between not only her and her mentor/father figure, but also Indys and his biological father. :serio: Thus, I am in favor of allowing Indys to participate as the principal's son. This could allow for some important cultural insights :idea: :serio:.

Indys gave him a thankful smile, which Herman reciprocated.

The principal seemed content with this conclusion.

**Principal Sayko:** Thank you, Herman, for using your Talent in a beneficial manner. 😌 Is your question hereby answered, Mihayl? :serio:

**Barton:** It better is :yao:. 'Cause I really wanna participate 🤨

**Mihayl:** *sighs and rolls his eyes* Alright. I will participate as well and not ruin it for everyone, despite how naive y'all are being 🙄 I will keep my eyes open for things that are sus though :sus:

**Principal Sayko:** Great. Are there any more questions? 😌

**Sakar:** Yes, where do we sign? :yao::yaonion:

**Herman:** By putting our right hands on the table... as he said ten minutes ago... 🙄

**Sakar:** Oh, yeah, right, sorry 😅:yaonion:

**Principal Sayko:** Do I take it that all of you are in for the exchange? 😌 Can everyone who wants to participate raise their hand? :idea: ... _One_ hand please, Barton :really:


[7/8/2025 6:57 PM] frangipani.
**Barton:** Aw maaan :yao::yaonion::malote:

Barton, who had been quick at raising both hands again, put one down. Not that it would change much, as more and more hands shot up. The principal's satisfaction rose as he counted the risen hands in real-time... until he realized his count stopped at 14.

**Principal Sayko thinking:** H-huh? Just fourteen? :e_e:

He quickly recounted, with the same result.

**Principal Sayko thinking:** B-but... how? :e_e: Who is missing? 🧐 

A millisecond later, he locked eyes with the fifteenth student. The only one with no hand risen.
Undya.

**Undya thinking:** I... 😣 ... am not sure if I should 😔

The principal opened his mouth to comment, but someone else reacted faster than him.

**Mihayl:** Undya, really? :yao: Again?! :derp: 

**Barton:** Wait what? :e_e: Don't tell me you're abstaining from this too :yao:

Now the entire student body seemed to lock eyes with Undya. Her face started to feel hot and sweaty.

**Undya thinking:** Oh God 😟 😖

**Wayra:** A double non-voter? 😳 What an unexpected turn of events :yao:.... at a really inconvenient time, if I may add :really:

Wayra squinted suspiciously at Undya who tried to ignore her and focus on the principal, as if he could save her from this situation.

**Principal Sayko:** Undya, you seem to be the only one who appears to have doubts on partaking in this project. This is surprising me, knowing your personality and team spirit 🤨. May I ask about your reasons? 🤨 

His words sounded harsher and more judgmental than expected. 

**Undya thinking:** Explain what had happened this morning? T-to everybody? 😳

Undya inhaled sharply, with burning cheeks and a bone-dry mouth. But no word came out.


[7/8/2025 7:27 PM] frangipani.
Her thoughts flashed back to this morning.

**Undya's dad (Flashback)** YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!!  🫵 😠 

The image of her dad disappeared from her mind, but the feelings stayed. The embarrassment, the hurt, the shame.

**Undya thinking:** I... can't... explain it to them 😓 They'd... hate my family 😅... it's better if they just hate... me 😔

Undya exhaled - and shook her head.

The entire room gasped. They were certainly not expecting this.

**Undya thinking:** Backlash... here I go 😣 😅

**Ilya:** Undya, what the fuck? :loco:

**Herman:** Are you being serious right now?! First Barton and now you?! 😠

**Barton:** B-but this is THE opportunity for all of us!! :loco:

Marina tried to calm the crowd by intervening.

**Marina:** Guys, guys, calm down a little 😅, if she doesn't want to go, we can find somebody else who-

**Principal Sayko:** I am afraid the tight schedule we're in doesn't allow us to find a replacement student. :serio: Thus, it is either all of you, or the project must be called off. :serio:

**Principal Sayko thinking:** Not entirely true, but... they can neither call my bluff nor see the knowledge I've blocked from them 😅. I know this girl, whatever is going on with her, she'll change her mind and accept in favor of the group's agreement :yaogo:. I hate forcing her hand, but... there's too much on the line. :serio:


[7/8/2025 7:27 PM] frangipani.
**Wayra:** WHAAAAT? Called off?!?! 😱

**Barton:** C'mon Undya, don't do this to us! We'll never get this type of chance again! :yao::derp:

**Mihayl:** Yeah, stop being so goddamn selfish, you stupid bi- 😡

**Nayobi:** SHUT THE FUCK UP EVERYONE!!! :loco: 😤

The office went silent. All eyes were on Nayobi now, whose menacing glance was enhanced by the dark make-up around her eyes.

**Nayobi:** I'll take it from here. :sserio:

Nayobi stood up, then looked at Undya.

**Nayobi:** Come. :sserio:

She said with a stern voice, then looked at Principal Sayko.

**Nayobi:** We'll be back in five minutes. I promise. :sserio:


[7/8/2025 7:59 PM] frangipani.
Before the Principal could say anything, Nayobi started walking towards the exit. Undya quickly got up and followed her suit.

**Undya:** I don't know what she is doing :e_e:, but it beats staying in here 😅

Following Nayobi out of the room, she tried to avoid looking at her peers' faces, but was sure she could sense their confused and angry stares. In this moment she was glad to not be an Empath.

Undya felt a small dose of relief as soon as she shut the principal's door and found herself in the hallway, where the atmosphere was much fresher, cleaner, and less antagonistic. Nayobi, however, kept walking.

**Undya:** Wh-where are we going? :e_e:

**Nayobi:** The patio. :sserio:

**Undya:** O-okay. :e_e:

**Undya thinking:** Why is even she sounding cold... does she care about this project? :e_e:

She caught up to Nayobi, and they stepped outside through the glass sliding doors.

Ahead of them lay the patio, empty and quiet at this hour. Despite the harsh sunlight, its plethora of both local and exotic plants and trees created a microclimate with lots of shadow and a surprisingly pleasant temperature.

**Nayobi:** Let's go visit Aura. :sserio:

**Undya:** Aura? :e_e: Why? 😳

**Nayobi:** Precautionary measurement. In case they'll peek at us from the office :sserio: - which _will_ happen. 😑

**Undya:** Precautionary...? :e_e:

**Nayobi:** Trust me. I know what I'm doing. :sserio:

The two girls walked towards the back area of the patio, and came to a halt at a small stone shrine that was located right between two large trees. On top of it, in a waterproof frame, sat a photo of a young teen girl with light brown hair, dark brown eyes, and a bright smile.

Undya sighed. Two years had passed, but looking at her photo still hurt.

**Undya:** H-hello Aura. 😟 😓


[7/8/2025 8:28 PM] frangipani.
Nayobi greeted the photo with a respectful nod, like a small bow, then turned her attention to Undya, who finally dared to voice her confusion.

**Undya:** Why did you bring me here? 😳 😅

The coldness from Nayobi's face disappeared, and on came an expression of genuine compassion. One she hadn't seen from Nayobi in a while.

**Nayobi:** This... is about your parents, isn't it? :yaogo: 

Undya let out a small gasp, as tears shot into her eyes.

**Undya:** H-h-how... 😳 :T_T:

**Nayobi:** The cracks in your blocking... don't say I didn't warn ya :yaogo: I wanted to prevent the other Empaths in this room from seeing it, especially that Indys guy. :sserio: Despite his demeanor, he still has a soft spot for Barton... so I am careful around him. :sserio: But here, we are too far away for them to eavesdrop or use their Talent on our emotions - even if they happen to look outside and see us :yaogo:.

Undya took a deep breath, still fighting the tears... till her gaze fell upon Aura's photo again.

**Nayobi:** It's okay, you can cry now... ☺️ Aura and I don't mind ☺️

Undya let out a sob, and two tears started rolling down her cheeks, almost as if they were synchronized.

**Nayobi:** There you go. Just breathe. ☺️

She said in a calm voice. Undya felt more tears falling down her cheeks, but she didn't try to stop them. Instead she just let them flow, focusing on her breathing... and feeling more and more relief.

Nayobi had the grace to not stare at her, but to focus on Aura's memorial shrine instead. Her calm attitude spread onto Undya, who, after a while, decided to speak...

**Undya:** H-how did you know... this was about my parents? :why: Did... my emotions tell you that? :T_T:

**Nayobi:** Yup. :sserio: Been there, felt exactly that. Fucking hurts, right? :sserio:


[7/8/2025 9:02 PM] frangipani.
Undya nodded slowly. She remembered how, 1.5 years ago, Nayobi's mother had kicked her out of the house just for becoming goth. It had been a huge shock to Undya, because up till then Nayobi's family had seemed completely harmonious. In hindsight she knew that this probably should've been a warning sign instead.

**Nayobi:** Y'know... we all want our parents to love us, right? No matter how we dress, what career we pick, whom we date... all we want is for them to be like, "hey, do whatever the fuck you want, and even if it's a mistake, we'll still love you the same as before". :sserio:

**Undya:** M-hm. :T_T:

**Nayobi:** Because that is what they _should_ do, it's their literal fucking job as parents. :sserio: Now, sadly, not all of us are lucky enough to receive that affection. I wasn't that lucky. Tornoda was even less lucky with her parents. Heck, even my goddamn perfect little sister wasn't "good enough" for mom anymore as soon as she "slipped up" once! 😠

She clenched her fists and teeth in spiteful arousal, then closed her eyes and breathed out, opening her fists again. Her mouth formed a slight smirk.

**Nayobi:** Heh. 😏 Imagine how shitty it would be if I had never rebelled against them, never called out my mom for her manipulative bs and her nonsense rules and my dad for his cowardish nature... or if Noda had never spoken up about the shit she and her siblings went through. :sserio:

Then she looked at Undya, curiously.

**Nayobi:** Your brother... you once told us that your parents aren't too fond of his career choice, ain't that true? :sserio:

**Undya:** Y-yeah... what about it? :e_e:

Nayobi grinned.

**Nayobi:** His band is fucking awesome. 😈

Then her grin disappeared and her face became dead serious.

**Nayobi:** I don't think I've ever told anyone, but... back then, their music saved my life. :sserio:


[7/8/2025 9:22 PM] frangipani.
Undya's eyes widened.

**Undya thinking:** Wha-... :e_e: Is she implying... :e_e:

Nayobi averted her gaze, looking at Aura's picture, then started to smile again.

**Nayobi:** Remember their song "T.Y.F.Y."? I listened to it so many times back then, and did so many drawings listening to it... it made me feel understood like no piece of media had ever done before :yaogo:

**Undya:** Really? 😳 D-do you know what the song is about? :e_e:

**Nayobi:** Of course silly, I know the lyrics by heart! 😂 It's about saying "thank you" to people for the stuff they helped you with, but also saying "fuck you" to the same people for the ways in which they've hurt you :sidea:. That song helped me process how to feel about my mother :syaoc:

**Undya:** Y'know... Dynlak was the main writer of this song... and he wrote it about our dad 😅

**Nayobi:** Really? Huh, doesn't surprise me :yaogo:. But do you see now... how fucking sad would it be if we never, _ever_ did anything that our parents didn't want us to do? :yaogo:

Undya stood and thought for a minute. Unsure what to say, she looked back and forth between the picture of her dead friend and the friend that was luckily alive (... thanks to her brother's music, apparently?!).

Finally, she decided to speak up about the _other_ thing that slowly kept crawling back into her mind.

**Undya:** Y'know, my parents, especially my dad, they don't trust the Cintreans. 😅 If I partake in this exchange... they won't be happy. 😅 

**Nayobi:** That doesn't matter :sserio:

**Undya:** H-huh? :e_e:

**Nayobi:** There's only one thing that matters: If you partake in the exchange... will _you_ be happy? :sserio:


[7/8/2025 10:26 PM] frangipani.
Meanwhile, inside the principal's office, the anger had dissuaded and turned into awkward silence. Impatiently the teens sat on their seats, waiting for Undya and Nayobi to return.

**Sakar:** When are they going to come back? :derp: We are missing the rest of class :yaonion::derp:

**Barton:** We are especially missing the VOTING part, silly :yao::derp:

**Yohan:** Can't we sign in for the exchange already, Mor- I mean, Mr. Sayko? 😅

**Principal Sayko:** No, we have to wait till the two missing students return. :serio:

**Barton:** Ahhhh but I'm bored :yaonion:

**Principal Sayko:** Patience, Barton, patience. Which is indeed a virtue you could benefit from. :yaoc: :serio:

Some more moments of silence pass. The clock ticks loudly and patiently.

**Barton:** Help... :yaonion: Can someone please say sth, ANYTHING, I cannot handle the silence any longer... 🫠 

Sakar cleared his throat and looked at the principal in nervous anticipation.

**Sakar:** Ahem, it's... nice weather we're having... right, Mr. Principal? :yaoc:

Some students laughed, while Barton facepalmed and sank deeper into his seat, as if he was embarrassed to be Sakar's friend. The principal chuckled at Sakar's half-assed attempt to make small-talk.

**Principal Sayko:** Oh yes indeed, my dear Sakar, it would be quite curious if it were raining inside this room instead :idea: 

**Indys:** Dad, please, this is too much cringe even for me :yao::derp:

**Mihayl:** Regretting your wish to participate now? 😏

**Yorin:** Be quiet, Mihayl 😇

**Mihayl:** What did you say? 😳 😠

**Yorin:** I said, be quiet. If you convince other people to not participate, the rest of us will be angry, not with Undya - but with you instead ☺️


[7/8/2025 10:47 PM] frangipani.
Meanwhile Herman, Marina, Tornoda and Sumi were exchanging glances.

**Sumi:** Should... one of us look outside again? :e_e:

**Tornoda:** Nah. They'll come back soon. Five minutes are almost over. :yaoc:

**Marina:** Do you guys... have any idea what Nay might be saying to Undya? 😅

**Herman:** There are multiple possibilities - either she convinces her to participate in favor of the group, or she gives her a quick therapy session with whatever deep-seated issue she may be suffering from nowadays. :serio: There is something unusual about her today, however, it is neither my duty nor concern. :serio:

**Tornoda:** Wow. That's... harsh? Even for your standards :really:

**Herman:** Might be. But the reason for that is not my place to talk about either, as I do not desire to emulate the immature behaviour of... certain others. :really:

He said, giving Mihayl, Barton and their friends a passive-aggressive side-eye.

**Marina:** Just... try to be kind to her, alright? :e_e: No matter what her decision may be 😅

Before anyone could reply, the door opened, and in came Undya, followed by Nayobi who was smiling confidently.

**Sakar:** Hey, there they are! :yao:

**Barton:** FINALLYYY 🫠 

**Principal Sayko:** Great to see that you are back. :serio:

**Marina thinking:** Undya's face looks a bit... different :e_e: Did she... cry? 😳

Undya walked up to Tedu's image on the crystalline platform next to the principal. There, she took a deep breath, turned around to her fellow students...

**Undya thinking:** Just imagine this as a class presentation 😮‍💨

...and spoke to them:

**Undya:** Hey again, you guys. I'm sorry I didn't raise my hand earlier. I still had some questions I needed answers to, and... Nayobi kindly helped me answer them 😅


[7/8/2025 11:05 PM] frangipani.
**Ovana:** *whispers to Yorin* Why did she ask Nay and not Herman tho? 🤨 

Yorin just shrugged in response, while Undya tried her best to ignore the whispers and resumed, now addressing the principal:

**Undya:** Principal Sayko 😅... to make up for the time lost, I want to be the first one to sign up for participation :sidea:

A loud collective exhale went through the room.

**Wayra:** YAAAAYYY!! 🤩 🥳 😮‍💨

**Mihayl:** She's come to her senses, it seems 😌

**Barton:** Hey Nay, what did you do to her? Did you wipe her brain with some gothic ritual or something? :yao::malote:

Nayobi, who sat down next to her boyfriend - who, in turn, shot Barton a warning glance -, turned around with an evil grin.

**Nayobi:** Oh, that wasn't even necessary 😇 Just told her where I'd bury her if she ruined this offer for all of us :malote:

**Mihayl:** Right next to Aura? :yao::malote: Cuz that's where you two were standing when I looked outside the room earlier :idea: How evil of you :malote:

Undya chuckled nervously.

**Undya:** Y-yeah, that was quite... threatening 😅 :yaonion:

**Principal Sayko:** Mihayl!! 😠 I don't want to hear such tasteless jokes from you anymore, this is a deceased student of this school we are speaking about! :serio: And Nayobi, I am letting this slide due to your good grades and development, but if I ever hear about you _using death threats_ again, I might have to question your suitability for this exchange! :serio: Is that clear, you two? :serio:

**Mihayl:** Yeah yeah 🙄

**Nayobi:** O-of course, it was an exception and won't happen again! Sorry, Mr. Sayko 😅 

**Principal Sayko:** Good. 😮‍💨 Then, let us finally begin the registration. Undya, will you do the honors? :serio:


[7/8/2025 11:40 PM] frangipani.
**Undya:** Sure. ☺️

She turned towards the crystalline table and took a deep breath. Under the watchful eyes and hopeful cheers of her classmates, she lifted her right hand and moved it towards the screen.

**Barton:** Do it, Undya! :yao::malote:

**Yohan:** You won't regret it! :idea:

**Wayra:** We will forever be thankful to you! 🤩 

Her hand approached the platform till her fingertips were only a few centimeters away from the screen.

**Undya thinking:** I know this choice cannot be undone... and my parents won't be happy 😣... but Nay was right - it is my choice to make... and I want to do it! 😠

With a rush of determination, she pressed her hand against the platform. A faint glow started to appear around the contours of her hand, which then increased in intensity. Everyone watched anxiously as a holographic blue panel appeared, creating a card that was very similar to Undya's student pass at Wega, even showing a picture of her face and some of her data:

_Full name: Undya Rahel Griber_
_Sex: Female_
_Date of birth: 19-07-2002_
_Place of birth: Ecuia City, Ecuia, Luria_
_School: Wega Academy_

...and so on.

The platform then read, _SCAN FINISHED. YOU MAY NOW RELEASE YOUR HAND_.


[7/8/2025 11:40 PM] frangipani.
Undya slowly pulled back her hand from the platform, and the profile dissipated. Instead a crystalline sphere appeared, showing her face once again.

Undya read out lout what it said on the platform.

**Undya:** "Approved. Welcome, Undya Griber" 👀 😳

And her fellow classmates erupted in cheers.

**Indys:** YAAAAYY!!! We're going to meet the Cintreans!! 🥳 🥳 

**Wayra:** We're going to boost our careers! 🥳 🥳

**Yohan:** We're gonna be famous in all of Ecuia!!! 🥳 🥳 

**Barton:** We're going to seduce hot Cintrean ladies!!! :malote::yaonion:🥳 

**Principal Sayko thinking:** Hm. Good thing it worked out 😌... wait a moment, what did Barton just say? :e_e:

Undya then turned around, over her classmates cheering and jumping up from their seats, getting in line after her. Undya's eyes met Nayobi's, who was next to a visibly impatient Herman. Nayobi smiled and gave her a thumbs up.

And suddenly she realized that there was something _more_ she had to do.


[7/9/2025 12:13 AM] frangipani.
Much later on this day, Undya and Marina arrived at Undya's place. Upon unlocking the door and entering, they were greeted with dead silence.

**Marina:** How... are you feeling? 😟

Marina asked as they took off their shoes and schoolbags in the hallway.

**Undya:** Relieved that they're not home from work yet. 😅 This will make things easier... for now :e_e:

**Marina:** Hey, if you want, we can break them the news together when they arrive :sidea:. If I'm around, they won't react as harshly :yaogo:

**Undya:** That's really kind of you 🥹, but let's plan that out later if that's okay for you :yaogo:. Right now I wanna see how my brother is doing 😅 

**Marina:** Alright 😊. I'll stay downstairs and fix us a quick meal, okay? ☺️

Undya smiled at Marina, then rushed towards her and gave her a hug.

**Marina:** Aww, what's that for? 🥹

**Undya:** That's a thanks, for... being there for me. ☺️ :sheart:

**Marina:** Oh... you're welcome 🥰

Undya then dissolved the hug and sprinted upstairs.

At the attic, she approached Dynlak's door, that had a sign out saying "FUCK OFF".

**Undya thinking:** Yeah, checks out 😅... hope he at least managed to get some sleep during the day :yaogo:

In spite of the sign's warning, Undya decided to not fuck off, but to instead knock on her brother's door.

Silence, then Dynlak's defeated-sounding voice.

**Dynlak:** Who's there? :really:

**Undya:** Just me. ☺️ May I come in? :yaogo:

**Dynlak:** *audible groan* Sure :really:


[7/9/2025 12:37 AM] frangipani.
She opened the door and entered Dynlak's realm. Between the dark curtains and dim light, inspirational band posters and tons of stuff scattered across the floor, there was Dynlak, on his favorite futon in front of an ultra-HD TV and a bunch of boxes of half-played games and frequently watched TV series. He appeared to be in the middle of rewatching "The kids all need therapy", a sitcom that Undya knew was one of his comfort shows, but paused as soon as Undya came in and closed the door behind her.

**Dynlak:** Did Mom send you? :really:

He looked annoyed, but at least the rings under his eyes had gotten smaller in comparison to this morning.

**Undya:** N-no, Mom and Dad aren't home yet 😅.

**Dynlak:** Good. I neither wanna see them nor talk to them. :really:

**Undya:** I can imagine 😅 How are you feeling? :yaogo:

**Dynlak:** How do you think I'm feeling? :really: My body hates me for last night, and now our parents hate me again too. Not that I'd care anymore :really:... can't do anything right anyway :derp:

**Undya:** Actually, that's not true 😅... and I came upstairs to tell you that :yaogo:

Dynlak let out a dry laugh.


[7/9/2025 12:37 AM] frangipani.
**Dynlak:** To absolve me of my hangover? Ha! :yao: :jajaja: Nice try, but that's not how it works - not even with _your_ Healing 😅

**Undya:** N-no, I meant something else 😅. I... look. I talked to someone at school today, who told me that your music saved her life. :yaogo:

Something in Dynlak's eyes seemed to change upon hearing these words.

**Dynlak:** Saved... her life? 😳

**Undya:** Those were the words she used. And she's not the type to say that metaphorically. :sserio: And also, I visited Aura's memorial today, and that made me remember that you and your music helped me too, after her passing. 😅 So... even if Mom and Dad can't see it or appreciate it, you are doing something meaningful by helping people process their emotions through your music. Probably every day. 😟

Dynlak blinked a few times, and Undya could swear he was holding back tears. Her speech seemed to have touched a nerve... just as she had thought.

**Dynlak:** Heh. Th-thanks for telling me that... I guess ☺️

He smiled, for the first time since this morning.

Undya started to feel nervous.

**Undya:** There's actually something else I also wanted to tell you. ☺️ 

But she couldn't help but smile.

**Undya:** And I bet you are going to love it. ☺️ :ukawaii:

**END OF CHAPTER 3**


[7/18/2025 5:56 PM] tastaturzvd
**Chapter 4: Inevitable**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruiXmrmWSUY&list=PL4BA0EB8FC7B4B020&index=3

As Undya started to talk to her brother Dynlak, one could see how the musician's expression became that of pure surprise and shock for a few seconds. Marina on the other hand, full with solemnity, simply turned on the lights of the guest's room dormitory. Looking at the instruments of study that was before her, once a remembrance of her purpose in Wega Academy: an academical exchange program that would broaden her horizons, now dawned on her with bitter realisation. What was going to be of her expectations for this year? Was it worth to say yes to such an unconventional and spontaneous program? She didn't know anymore, all she could feel is the fear... and overall sensation of pressure that her Empathic senses caught on, leaving her with an off-flavoured aftertaste.

She sat on the desk's chair, opened the window beside her and let air flow in. She took a deep breath and rest her head gently on her hand. "Is Undya going to be fine?" went through her mind, hair flowing across her face, while the rumbled sound of Undya's and Dynlak's conversation resonated through the walls.

But she wouldn't be the only one patiently stalling in that moment, since through space and time, somewhere in the Cintrean capital of Xylos Nun, a short-haired blonde woman dressed in a formal Naori Command Security Call Center orange jumpsuit, one with of an advanced metallic chest plate filled with crystalline runes that led to a radiating core at the centre, was following the same footsteps. It was Candanz Korr, ST-7  Command officer, now in her regular attire preparing some crystalware equipment on a specialised chamber, whose windows had a high profile view of the faintly purple Cintrean sky. 

She was adjusting some parameters, calibrating some information with her own personal technology, comparing them with crystalline glass planes that showcased a multitude of monochrome files and graphs, most of them encrypted to prevent onlookers to watch over their delicate contents.

[7/18/2025 6:17 PM] tastaturzvd
Yet at some moment, a clacking sound resonated across the room, it was the sound of someone entering the saloon with due diligence, and on schedule too. Candanz opened a control panel and peeked at the information of the incoming person, an almost reactionary impulse of protocol led by years of conditioning, the information displayed: `Erthoun Charr, <Student in Transition> from Group C9A`. 

She steadied her breath, preparing herself for what was about to come, but it was futile, hence the voice of a desperate man started to bark at her immediately, prompting her turn her gaze.

**Erthoun:**  So, what the hell do you need me for, **Lieutenant**? Better not tell me it has to **do **with those good for nothing! :really:

> Meanwhile, on a different room, there were three people looking at each other: Goura Honut, the ever-enthusiastic scientist, relief extenuating from his relaxed stance, Leyna Aru, the cheering and hyperactive gentle heart, checking on her friend with a face filled with empathy and concern, and Keithra Kas Omou, the *missing girl*, guilt drawn on every facet of her gaze.

**Keit:**  I-I take you have a lot of questions… right? 😅  🥺 

> Keit knew the situation she was trapped in right now. Her friends were right in front of her with no idea what was truly going on behind the scenes. She knew she owed them explanations, explanations she can't even begin to formulate. The memories that flooded her mind, the sensation of being out of control, sailing a broken ship towards an uncertain end... 

> She couldn't even think what would be of her now, if her fate was just beginning to seal into true disappointment, like she always thought it'd inevitably would.

> But reality was different... more nuanced than that. She knew that regardless of what would be of her now, it'd be result of the person she became. And even with all that crippling doubt on her soul, her very essence, hope would sill inevitably rise. 

**Goura:** You bet! First of all, why are you in the principal’s cabinet? :idea:  Second of all, WHY the principal’s cabinet? :yao: And third of- :yaonion:

Leyna put a hand on Goura's shoulder, knowingly

**Leyna:** Goura, I think she gets it…  😅

> After all, these were two of her most reliable friends. They would understand, they *had* to comprehend her pain. This wasn't a matter of whether she is the perfect Kas Omou girl she wanted to become anymore, it was whether she was even a *girl* anymore. A girl worth caring, a girl worth being seen. A girl worth *being found*.

**Keit:** I… I-I see. Well… 😓  💦

> And if for that what was going to take out of her is to try to turn the cogs in her favour, even if it hurt her... even if seemed unfair.... Reality was unfair, it has always been to her. She was meant to lose every bit of hope she had out of her grasp.

Images in succession went by: of man shouting in desperation as someone is being taking by some soldiers, of a teen with a braided tail crying, accusing the same silhouette, of the bottomless contempt of a pink-haired figure taking a metallic object from them, and of a veteran turning his back on them

>  So why bother now? They wouldn't hear anyway. Maybe now... but the inevitable remained like so: *inevitable.*


[7/18/2025 7:50 PM] tastaturzvd
**Keit:** I-It... 😅  was... necessary for the project to even be possible for us in the first place. 😓 

> Why bother.

**Goura:** Whaaaaa!?? :e_e: :dafuq: 

**Keit:** I-I mean, it's complicated. 😅

> Why bother since it really wasn't, it was simple. She wouldn't admit it, not to them, not to the rest of her friends... not even to herself. The snowball already started rolling, better enjoy it before it stops. Better play the game... a snowfight is never over until the ice melts. Or until they give up fighting.

**Keit:**  Did Master Iwa.... tell you we are going to interact with students on planet Luria?

> Even if spring is coming, is better to always look at what is upfront.

**Goura:** Wait... a minute. :e_e: 😳 

> Who can really tell if an ice age will suddenly appear, right?

**Leyna: **STUDENTS!? ON LURIA!? :loco: :huuh: 

> Who can really tell... if all it is going to be for nothing.

But then, voices resonated clearly through the call:

**Omon:** I assume you think the mission was successful :serio:

> Simple, clear, daring.

**Zinda: ** I sincerely hope so, hence it was a move that carries on its own clear risks. :sserio:

> Monotonous, rigid, true-to-the-fact.

**Neia:** Guys, it had to be done! 😅  They were hiding her location! :really:  How am I supposed to bring her to the reunion otherwise? :derp:

> Desperate, defensive, determined.

**Azar:** By… you know, assuming that whoever hid her location is going to bring her anyway? 🤷‍♂️  I like having a bit of amusement from time to time, Neia, but **even I** think you were exceeding yourself a *tiny* bit there. :yaogo:

> Detached, cynical, bored.

**Hemo:** Hate to say it, but white scalp’s got a point. :really:

> Impatient, raspy and pragmatic.

> These were the voices of people being moved by in the arctic winds. Some with a weather forecast already secured, some being guided by the faint scent of the nose. 
> 
> What is there to hope for these people? Does it matter if it was for "nothing at all"?
 
**Neia:** C’mon, we’ve got no time to act! :derp:

> Because even if she doesn't want to fight, someone else will for her.

**Neia:** Everyone has to be there in less than an hour, we can’t just miss it with an excuse… 🙄

> Till the bitter and most cruel reality of it all.

`Quick flashback to Xicaru, Norian and Sathki`

**Neia:** …even if we wanted to.

> That only the ones above are in control.


[7/18/2025 9:53 PM] tastaturzvd
In a shift of scene to the secret reunion, things started to thicken. Erthoun, sit on one of the many spaces available on the room, leaned forward in absolute rage.

**Erthoun:** What the hell? You mean to tell me I can’t leave their group because of this *goddamn* project!? 😠 💢

> Making a commotion out of his petty desire to leave the group, shutting down his protest is immediately due, a cold, hard line is in order.

**Candanz:** No, you cannot. This project isn’t some extracurricular event you can miss at will. :sserio:

Erthoun's face was one of complete disbelief. His teeth tightened, his breath quickened. To him, this was personal, like a gut punch of an insult, one he cannot stand for.

**Erthoun:** How does that make any sense!? You cannot force us to participate... I don’t give a damn if your superior is some Neptai ranking officer!!  😡  💢

> The boldness of his statement, completely against protocol. One cannot simply dare to question the decisions that one cannot ever begin to comprehend. Discipline is required.

**Candanz:** This is not just an order from him, it is a collaborative effort. Every student has to be here at the time it is demanded of them. Not complying with it could have serious consequences. :sserio: 💢

Erthoun got up of his chair in a tantrum.

> He is overreacting to this, this is unacceptable.

**Erthoun:** What do you mean serious consequences!? :derp: 😡 💢

> State the obvious, leave no room for doubt.

**Candanz**: Missing the major biggest opportunity ever given to a group of students in the history of the Utam institution. :sserio:

> This is the Cintrean way.


[7/18/2025 10:26 PM] tastaturzvd
> And on the other side, it was just starting.

**Goura:** Whaaaat? A program where we interact with students from an academy on Luria!? :cwhut: 

**Leyna:** THAT’S CRAZY! :o_O: No… THAT’S COMPLETELY BONKERS!!! :loco: :gah: 

**Goura:** Yeah! Like… I understand participating in some project with the Command on Luria’s surface but… working with Lurians!? Like, hand-to-hand!? :e_e:

> Hence they just couldn't believe what they were hearing. 
> 
> The Lurian program, being an exchange program that involved interacting with actual natives sounded like a ridiculous notion. It is like asking a Spaniard to go to the Americas when it has just barely been confirmed there was land with some *weird* people living there, even if they were not.

**Keit:** An academy from Ecuia City, one of the main capitals of the planet, was chosen for the cultural exchange program… we are meant to go there and… live like Lurians do. 😅 

> It sounded outlandish, unreasonable. Like something someone would come up with after having spent too much time under zero gravity.

**Leyna:** K-Ky but- I can barely manage living like Cintreans do… h-how am I supposed to even survive living like them? 😓 

> But to her, it was even more personal than that.

**Keit:** I know it sounds crazy but… :e_e: 😓 

**Goura:** Y-You are aware that Luria was a planet discovered just 4 years ago… right? :e_e:

> It wasn't just some logistical fallacy.

**Leyna: **Not everyone has had first-hand education in the Naori Command, Ky… 😓 

> It was a matter of life and death.

**Keit:** S-So… you don’t want to go? :T_T:


[7/18/2025 10:40 PM] tastaturzvd
> Yet even being faced with death, there are some gems that shine through.

Leyna crouched to Keit's eye level to look at her upclose.

**Leyna:**  Ky, what is it? Why is this so important to you? You can tell us. 😟 

> But what use is that shine in a white world where every reflection shines?

**Keit:** I-I… I… can’t really tell you guys but… please. :why: You need to reconsider it… 😭

>  What use is there when there are some things... that cut through even the toughest diamond or outshine the brightest bulb.

Principal Iwa entered the room unwarranted.

**Iwa:** No, you don’t need to. :sserio:

Leyna turned around dumbfounded.

**Leyna:** HUH!?? What do you mean Master Iwa!?? :surprised: 

> Since they are capable of **running over** you, no matter what.

**Iwa:** Group C9A is going to go there no matter what you students decide. What has been given to you is not an offer, is a mandate. :sserio:

**Leyna:** HUUUUH!!??? :gah: :gasp: 

**Goura:** A mandate? You are going to force us to live... WITH LURIANS!?? :gasp: :huuh:

Outro: <Scene with Keit studying diligently on a library until complete burnout until Undya comes in to gives a hand with a smile, one that she returns. Herman seems happy about it in the background.>

Intro: <Scene with Xicaru trying to catch some rays on the beach, Eri next near him on the sand. Azar—with a bunch of sun cream on his entire body—Zinda and Barton in the background below a sun umbrella. After a wave runs over him and he makes a pokerface, Eri laughs faintly in the background while Azar and Barton burst outloud, just to be both shut up by Zinda with a bonk on the head>

> Iwa walked into the room, serenely and effortlessly, surrounding her students, almost like a lioness taunting her prey.

**Goura:** Like seriously, Master Iwa, isn't that a bit too far-fetched? Being with Lurians is one thing, but *studying* with them!? :e_e: **Living with them!?** :gasp:

**Iwa:** It is a marvellous opportunity, is it not? 💅  Just imagine what incredible insights you could get on Lurian science, culture… society in general. 😌 

**Goura:** I-I mean, I have no doubt but… :e_e: 💦 

> Leyna looked unsure, frightened, confronted. She was thorn between saying how she really feels or helping her friend, who clearly wanted this project to work out.

**Leyna:** S-Sorry to tell you Master Iwa b-but… *I'm just not qualified for that.* 😅 

> Her words slipped, she knew this wasn't what Keit or the Principal wanted to hear, immediately confirmed by the closed pose she adopted. Frightened by her stare she concurred.

**Leyna:** L-Like… you can take the rest of the group but…  😓

> Leyna's face flushed of embarrassment.

**Leyna:** I just... can't. 😖 

> Chill ran down Keit's spine, crippling fear squeezed her chest like an all-encompassing claustrophobic sensation. She could see it again: first Tedu, now her. Every single one of the people that matter most to her are destined to leave her live, *inevitably*.

**Keit:** *Lyn*? :T_T: 

> Her tone was shaky, weak. Begging for mercy. 
> 
> Iwa took a quick look at the girl, reading her expression and trembling body, and then asked:

**Iwa:** Don’t you see what you are doing to the poor girl, Ms. Aru? :sserio:

> Leyna froze, her face got brighter as she looked back at her friend, back at the principal, back at her, back and forth.

**Leyna:** I-I KNOW BUT! 😳 😫 

> But she had to say it, she couldn't just stand there, she knew what it would mean to fail at an opportunity like this. It was not about whether it would right for her to do it... 

**Leyna:** L-Like… don’t you get it? I barely passed Synthesis exams… h-how am I supposed to do something like this!? 😓 

> It was whether she would be destroying everyone else alongside herself.

**Leyna:** *Wouldn’t I be getting in everyone’s way?* 😖 

> Goura stared at Leyna like a statue, not knowing what to do.
> 
> Keit... was just waiting for the worst to happen before her eyes. 
> 
> But the principal, she simply stood there for a moment. Then a quiet laughter could be heard through the room.

**Iwa:** My, how *incredibly* cute. 🤭 ☺️ 

> The three looked back at her in confusion. Iwa proceeded.

**Iwa:** Lurians aren’t exactly the most advanced. ☺️  We are talking about a civilisation that is *several * centuries inferior to ours technologically. :sidea:

**Leyna:** Eh? :o_O: 

> Leyna stood there dumbfounded, one second she was a tomato waiting to be squashed to be turned into *pasta alla bolognese*, the other she is just completely and utterly confused.
> 
> The principal doesn't let them process what she said that much through.

**Iwa:** You might be going to Refinement school next cycle :idea: but in this exchange program, your goal isn’t to ace exams... ☺️  :yaogo:

**...is to be yourself.**


[7/19/2025 6:50 PM] tastaturzvd
> The reaction from the students was almost instinctual.

**Leyna:** What!!!???? 😱 

**Goura:** No exams!!!? :loco: 

> They simply couldn't comprehend, let alone picture a world where they didn't have to perform, to be evaluated. It was almost alien to them, just as alien as... it would be to go and coexist with the people of a planet they barely had any knowledge of. 
> 
> While the network the Cintrean Meritocracy formed a part of wasn't new of people going to different planets and being exposed to vastly different cultures, to them it was akin to 21st century Earthlings visiting different countries within their sole home planet.

**Iwa:** Lurians at your age aren’t exactly the type to only care about performance like most people in our society do. :sserio:

> Lurians may look human, but their history was different, their technology ancient but oddly fascinating, their true nature was... unknown.

**Iwa:** They care about socializing, having parties, playing games, having relationships... :sidea:

> To people like the Cintreans, it was like looking back at a portrait of yourself when you were young, but knowing that the person you see isn't even you, as most atoms that formed part of your being back then aren't part of you anymore.
> 
> But worse, since that person you see... was never you in the first place, but a mirage of what you could have been if you were *different*.

**Goura:** So… you are sending us to… slack off? Like… Novan vacations? :e_e:

> And even more tragically... the parallels, the comparatives... most were lost in time, scattered across by a division that made them mostly forget who they were.
> 
> Nova... Terra... The Solar System... Earth.
> 
> They were but a distant memory many didn't... no, couldn't even remember.

**Leyna:** And what is that thing of “*being ourselves*”? :e_e:

> What meant to those from a society that forgot their origins, one that replaced those for merit... for the insatiable necessity of never-ending progress, "to be yourself"?

**Iwa:** It’s pretty simple, you’ll be sent there like a researcher going back in time to make notes on Old Earth’s civilisation, :idea: but with no time backtracking consequences. :Excelente:  

If you desire to show the Lurians how you live, you may do so. :yaogo:  It is a cultural exchange program. :idea: 

Naturally, it is all about studying the difference in culture between our societies... 😌 

> Because to them... being yourself... was all about utility. Tools so used to be tools that they forgot they ever were metal capable of being reshaped.

**Iwa:** …in this game, anything goes.

> So a mission of rediscovery,
> 
> of seeing the process that made them tools,
> 
> of the *would-be* places their minerals were extracted from,
> 
>  was truly in order.

> Yet... not all of them, would be prepared for it.

> As in the meantime, back at that call...
﻿
> With Zinda and Azar on the academy's recreation area, the cynic playing *Rock Spot!* casually with just one hand and slurping some soda with the other and the deadpanned girl sitting next to his position close enough to be at arms' reach, on a virtual magnetically-aligned chair unbothered, her right arm projecting an hologram,
> 
> With Omon just outside the academy's crystalware backlog warehouse, the rule-bearing supervisor leaning on a wall, people passing by his location and attending their own business,
> 
> With Neia and Hemo, both on his personal hangar, the pragmatist right in front of his mainline computer, a table of operations full of cyberpunk machinery, and the *president*, right beside him,

> ...something was about to inevitably be unveiled.

Azar hit the ball just in the right position for it to fall into the perfect *spot*, perfectly in tune with his calculations, to get the jackpot of Rock Spot! for the third time in a row. 

He seemed unfazed by it. Not even worth celebrating in his eyes.

**Azar:** Hold on, so the thing is *that* prioritary? :yaogo:  Thought it was simply some invitation from Omon’s teach’. :lmfao:

Zinda talked over him, not even turning to Azar but rather focusing on the call as if he or the game's fanfare were not even there with her. None of that noise leaked onto the call either.
﻿
**Zinda:** Haven’t you been paying any attention at all? 🙄 It explicitly says it is a direct order from the Naori Command. :really:

Azar took the club on rubbed its tip on his chin, the contact with his own weak deflectors creating faint electrostatic. 
﻿
**Azar:** That could mean *many* things… and it is not like the Command has any authority over us. :idea: Made me skim through this last semi... :yao:

He made some circular movements with the stick.

**Azar:** ...but we kinda are protected under the Ninth Amendment of Interministerial Affairs... and the 42th statue of the Yuhan Doctrine that goes on about institutional staffing and event preambles. :yao:

He prepared for playing a new round of the game, and calculated his shot in a second or two as he continued.

**Azar:** We ain't at war anymore, so Third Order protocols shouldn't be overriding anything nowadays. :yaoc: Even though there are some *minor* details you've got to take into acc- :idea:
﻿
Omon from his side, stared dumbly at his screen with a long face and raised brows for a moment, like saying "*was that necessary?*" before cutting him off:

**Omon:** May be true, but Lieutenant Korr still is Kas Omou’s disciple and he is a mentor we should follow just because of his sheer meritocratic level. :serio: 

Azar shrugged, then a sly grin drew on his mouth. 
﻿
**Azar:** Guhhh, stop fangirling :yao: We all know you’re crushing on him~ :malote:

Omon facepalmed with a defeated exasperation.

**Omon:** Azar… not now. :really:

Azar's palpable confidence could be heard from Omon's imperceptible megaphone. 

**Azar:** Hah, your silence is deafening! :malote: :uwu: 

The blunt sound of something hitting his head and his cry "hey, you made me miss my shot!" as well.

Azar now kinda pissed about his miss, went to return the club back to where it originally belongs as he drank a sip off his sparkling water container.

Zinda automatically teased a strand of her hair, while still holding the hologram in place.

**﻿Zinda:** President, we need to make sure everyone is coming to the reunion. :sserio:


[7/20/2025 2:57 AM] tastaturzvd
Neia got spooked up by the sudden command, like she was lost in her thoughts as she was listening in. Hemo meanwhile, was simply attending to his robot Trinket, who was asking attention of him, as it had found something important for what he was working on earlier that day.

**Neia:** R-Right. 😅  Omon, are you certain Norian is going to attend? :sserio: 

Omon thought for a moment, looking at nowhere in particular.

**Omon:** It was hard at first but… :kthinking:

`Flashback to him talking to Norian. The memory of Norian's genuine expression as he said he was going to reconsider the "offer", was fresh on his mind.`

Omon made up his mind.

** Omon:** I convinced him it is something important he doesn’t want to miss. I don’t think checking on him is necessary :serio:

Neia jumped in as soon as Omon finished his statement, quickly opening a floating crystalline control panel on her right, one that contained those management options she has available as the leader of her group. Hemo, seeing that Trinket became overtly excited, turned to look at her upset: *"Watch it, prez*". 

**Neia:** Perfect! No need to call him then. 😅  Now... just give me a moment all of you... :yaonion:

Azar, who was just putting the club for *Rock Spot!* back on its place, hesitated for a minute, his eyes moving swiftly around.

**Azar:** What... are you going to do? :e_e: 

In Neia's panelling system, some spheres appeared all around, as she masterfully picked five of them from the bunch before dissolving them into her terminal.

She paused for a moment... thinking of she was about to do. She sighed and closed her eyes in a mantra: *"It has to be done.... I'm the president, it's fine..."*

**Neia:** You'll see Azar. 😮‍💨

The club clicked in its place, something in Azar's mind did as well.

**Azar:** Oh... :derp:

Trinket suddenly exited the scene, Hemo after calling him *"Trinket!"* worryingly, went to go after him.


[7/20/2025 3:46 PM] tastaturzvd
Urza and Iluia, the diligent heiress studying some pages from what it seemed to be an old fashioned book with a scarlet ruby on its middle and the delicate nurse enjoying some quality *blurrion* tea, attended the call in unison.

**Urza:** Yes? Better be fast, Amaritan. :serio: :really:

**Iluia:** Hmm~ 😋 

She flipped another page.

Xicaru and Eri, the ambitious meritocrat, practising a lance sport involving popping some crystalline balloons, which he did aggressively, using far too much levelling than it is recommended and the redhead sitting as she waited, answered as he commanded.

**Xicaru:** Whaddup, need somethin'? :serio: 💢

**Eri:** H-Hi Neia… 😅  😓 

He missed another strike.

Sathki and Yuha, entering the locker rooms following a shower after their training, as then the professional levelling trainee immediately joined in as she swirled her finger to quickly tie her hair in a ponytail.

**Sathki:** H-Hey guys! 😄  Why did you call me? 😅 

She closed another door.

`Scene pauses.`

`Disk screeching.`

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNHooTszyW4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7npse9n-Yw

`Trinket appears in front of the scene, breaking the fourth wall. It starts beeping around like R2D2.`

[**Trinket:** (voice-over translation) Notice, notice. In Cintrean society, places of personal hygiene like showers, pools or saunas are considered as natural as any other recreational space. Nudity is not as frowned upon as in other cultures, nor is it immediately seen in a sexual or romantic connotation like people do on Old Earth's society. Do not let your pervy minds astray, humans!]

`Hemo appears in front of the scene.`

[**Hemo:** There you are, don't go out missing like that you! >:v 😤 ]

`He takes Trinket grumpily out of the scene with him.`

`Scene resumes.`

Hemo appeared back with Trinket on the hangar, telling him to stay quiet. 

Neia pressed onwards.

**Neia:** Now that all of you are here :idea: 😁 I need you to confirm to me that you are all assisting at the reunion scheduled at 23.00 GSH 😄 

Sathki looked at her own reflection on her locker's door for a moment as she put the ensign of her academy on her chest which immediately spread the fabric of her uniform in her body upon contact, contemplating something.

**Sathki:** O-Of course! Now I saw the announcement... hehe. 😅  I’ll be th- 

But then, interruption.

**Xicaru:** *Why would I participate in that thing?* 😑

> The chaos had commenced...

Urza snapped her book close audibly, a faint hint of scarlet mist leaving the pages.

**Urza:** Seriously Inoi? Declining a petition from your previous mentor because he didn’t give you his mentorship line? :really: 💢

Xicaru tightened the grip on his rod, whitening his knuckles. He yelled.

**Xicaru:** YOU KNOW I DESERVED IT!! 😠

Seeing it coming all over again, Azar's demeanour flat-lined. His predictability felt painful to him.

**Azar:** (whispering between teeth) *What you deserve is a good kick in the nuts for being that petty, dude.* 🙄 :derp:

Neia's chest clenched and contorted, feeling a stinging pain....

**Neia:** P-Please Xicaru, it’s just- 😅 

Since Urza, wasn't having the patience that day...

**Urza:** I told you several times before and I’ll tell you again until it gets through your thick skull. 🙄 💢 Kas Omou gives his line only to those he considers family. :sserio: You didn’t want to listen to me. 😠

Xicaru's grip created a dent on his lance.

**Xicaru:** IT IS HER, IS IT NOT? SHE’S THE ONE BEHIND ALL THIS!  😡 💢

Hemo flinched, startled by the commotion. He looked intently at the president, as if telling her something with his sight.

**Neia:** X-Xicaru, U-Urza, can we talk in a civilised manner for one minute? 😅


[7/20/2025 4:38 PM] tastaturzvd
He wasn't having it, it was to no avail...

Eri just closed her eyes, sinking on her sit. She knew all of this too well. *Why didn't she warn them?*

**Xicaru:** You know that it was her, right!??  😡 Like, who else could it be!? Freaking Omon!?? :derp: 

Omon, frowning intensively, felt his face getting hotter and hotter.

**Omon:** I have nothing to do with this... 😑 💢

Xicaru pierced the artificial grassy floor below him.

**Xicaru:** SEE!?? :loco: I BELIEVE HIM! 😡

While Azar came back as tired as if she he'd just been on a jog, Zinda simply replied, glistening her fingernails with her fingers, despite there being no static.

**Zinda:** This has nothing to do with Keithra either, Xicaru. 😑 

Xicaru stomped to the ground, and prepare to launch another strike to a balloon.

**Xicaru:** Where the heck was that loser anyway!? Have you even found her!? :derp: :really: 💢

He launched the pole with such force, that he not only missed the balloon, but instead of shattering it, it damaged the wall where it hanged even with its deflective protection on.


[7/20/2025 5:08 PM] tastaturzvd
Neia drew a sharp breath with her teeth, felt a drop of cold sweat forming on her forehead.

**Neia**: Y-Yes... we did... 😅 

Xicaru called the pole back with a finger hand motion.

> It still was salvageable... 

> But Azar finished drinking his water... 

**Azar:** She appeared to be on the principal's dorm of all places :yao: Just imagine the possibilities of what may be happening there... :malote:

> ...and decided to spill the beans.

Zinda shot a venomous stare at him. Azar whispered: "*What? Can't lie.*".

**Neia:** Heheh... yeah... that... was kinda urgent you see guys? 😅 

Urza scoffed, putting the book she was reading on her lap.

**Urza:** Doesn’t surprise me one bit. :really:

Neia was feeling more trapped by the second. Hemo gets near Neia once more, now genuinely invested in it, frowning.

**Neia:** Don’t worry, she’ll likely be there for- :idea: 😅 

Xicaru threw the pole into the ground behind him out of sheer frustration, breaking it's tip.

**Xicaru:** WHAT!??? OF COURSE SHE IS! SHE IS PLANNING ALL OF THIS WITH HER! :loco: She has planned my doom ever since she came to this academy!! 😤 😡 💢

Sathki was just standing there, not moving.

**Sathki:** Guys… W-What's going on? :e_e: 😅 

Azar was starting to chuckle at how ridiculous this was becoming.

**Azar:** Bah, now you are sounding like you want some silvery decor on your head. 😂 :malote:

But over at his hangar, someone wasn't liking was he was hearing once he starting to actually pay attention.

**Hemo:** Yea! The heck are you talking about, idiot!? Stop spouting crap about Twolocks! 😠 💢


[7/20/2025 5:22 PM] tastaturzvd
Xicaru's voice got deeper and more threatening.

**Xicaru:** Don’t get me started with you, **Orion**.  😑 😡

Hemo slammed his console with a thug.

**Hemo:** And what the hell did I do wrong now!??  😡

Xicaru kept shouting.

**Xicaru:** What do you mean you did wrong now!?? I saw what happened some minutes ago, naturally I knew it was YOU! 😡 🫵 

Neia shook her head desperately, extending her hands and turning her extending palms left and right. Hemo... was already too deep into the conflict to be able to hear.

**Hemo:** Freaking *prez* told me to do it, damn it! And it was important!! 😠 :derp:

Xicaru's voice started to distort over the voice-line. Or perhaps it was his own voice.

**Xicaru:** You just wanted a chance to use your freaking thing, didn’t you!!? 😠  💢 What good is Meritocracy when all you want is retribution for stupid ass people in your stupi-!! 😡

But taking it personal with a pirate? The worse mistake one can make.

**Hemo:** Ohhhh… now you’ve done it, punk!! Come to my hangar, I dare ya!! 😡

**Neia:** Hemo… don’t- 😳 😰 

A trembling finger ran over a crystalline panel in seconds, before smashing it into pieces in a fist. A voice boomed, cutting through the discussion like a hot knife through ice.

**Urza:** Inoi, will you stop deviating from **THE CONVERSATION AT ONCE!? HALT THIS NONSENSE, IF NOT I’LL MAKE YOU SEE TRUE RETRIBUTION MYSELF!** 😡


[7/20/2025 5:39 PM] tastaturzvd
The both of them instantly went quiet.

Xicaru's widened like he has just seen a ghost. Hemo snapped out of it.

Silence... 

Iluia looked at Urza, her tea on hand. Sound didn't come out of Urza, since she muted herself from others in the room and booted her friend out of the conversation.

**Urza:** **Rgh**, *impudent childman*. 💢 Amaritan, please, take the floor!  :really: 💢

Neia was still perplexed by what just happened.

**Urza:** Amaritan! 😠

 She had lasted a moment to react. But like a software being rebooted, she then started to talk almost instintually. 

**Neia:** Uhhhh… yes, o-of course. 😅 As I was saying y’all, I need confirmation if you are going to… be ready to go towards the stated location. It’s really important because… we may never know if it is something truly mandatory. 😅  (*What... the hell just happened...* 😓 )

Xicaru had his hand on his face, his levelling was so high the static was generating smoke.

**Xicaru:** **Fine.** I’ll tell Keit’s brainwashed **Fort slave** that I won’t be moving my ass from here personally then. :really: 💢 **I’m off!** 😠

Xicaru left the call. Seconds later, Eri did so too.

Azar, simply cringing internally, laughed softly to himself, shaking his head.

**Azar:** He will be moving his ass from here anyway, won’t he? 😂 

Zinda had no question in her mind.

**Zinda:** He’ll attend. :really:


[7/20/2025 5:53 PM] tastaturzvd
Urza unmuted herself and allowed Iluia to rejoin, she cleared her throat as she hit her chest softly.

**Urza:** My apologies 😑  but I’m seriously baffled how Kas Omou managed to educate such an incredible outlier of both genius and *incredible* stupidity. :really: At least I acknowledge the braided peasant tries her hardest, even though I must admit I don’t see her deserving that Kas Omou title either. :sserio:

Iluia, even while missing the full context, couldn't help but add:

**Iluia:** Don’t be so rude to him dear, he clearly isn’t on his best day. ☺️  

Omon, who was moving his legs around fiercely while the entire thing happened, squishing her forehand with his hand, finally spoke.

**Omon:** His attitude won’t go unnoticed, Rin. :serio: And you are.... free to state your opinion. 😓

Azar slouched over the *Rock Spot!* machine.

**Azar:** The dude woke up with a stick of chills up his ass and decided to spit fire. :yao:

Zinda looked back at him with a death stare.

**Zinda:** Can you please watch your tongue? 😑 

Azar grinned with his teeth, closing his eyes confidently.

**Azar:** How can I watch my tongue if it is attached to my mouth? 🤭 :malote:

Zinda hit Azar with a *Rock Spot!* club from a distance.

**Azar:** Ouch! 😣  *How did you even get that?* :derp: :yaonion:


[7/20/2025 6:02 PM] tastaturzvd
Neia sat on a chair next to Hemo, exhausted from the ordeal. Hemo proceeded to focus in other things to not accidentally make things worse again.

**Neia:** Ms. Ohm, Xin, are you two going to...? 😅 😮‍💨 

Urza put her book next to her, as she fixed her attire.

**Urza:** No need for me to even answer the question... 😑 my own inquiry rather is: :sserio: Where are those you clearly sent to ask us about… Keithra’s… whereabouts? :really:

Neia attended to a message sent via text by Sathki, who had also muted herself off the conversation. Then she realized she was being asked something.

**Neia:** Oh! Sorry... Goura and Leyna? 😅 I sent them… to the Principal’s dormitory… to speak with Master Iwa directly… heheh. 😅 ... 😓 

Urza moved to the edge of her seat.

**Urza:** You did *WHAT*!? 😳 

**Iluia:** Oh dear heavens above… 😅


[7/20/2025 6:21 PM] tastaturzvd
[...]

Omon exhaled and inhaled. 

> Worst already's over.

**Omon:** She was being contained by the principal in a way that violated protocol even *she* has to follow. :serio:

**Urza:** How does that justify that risky move!?  :derp: What were you thinking, Amaritan!? 😠

> At least for him.

> Neia... was now starting to doubt herself.

Neia started to stutter.

**Neia:** T-That was the only way to- 😅 

> Urza didn't really believe it.

**Urza:** To what!? The principal had her, it was under her *control*! :derp: Your authority just goes so far, you didn’t have to step in, no… worse, you didn’t have to send your two most *vulnerable* assets to her lair! :kbruh:

> Zinda tried to recount events... and then made her assessment.

**Zinda:** Urza, she wasn’t playing fair either, tactically she cannot do anything to them. :sserio:

> But apparently... even she did it wrongly.

**Urza:** If she plays by the rules… and she just demonstrated *by your own admission* she wasn’t. :derp:

> And he... knew it.

**Azar:** Oooh, not bad for a classy snob. :yaogo:

> Which is why... she didn't react this time. Instead... took her time to think.

**Zinda:** That... is a fair counterpoint I failed to consider, I’ll admit that much. 😑  Neia, you should have looked at the inconsistency and pointed it out. :sserio: Omon, you also perpetuated the mistake. :really:

> And he...  was quite flustered about it as he realized it.

**Omon:** Sigh... I just saw it as something delicate that impairs the principal’s ability to report due to its highly anomalous and suspicious nature. I saw no issue with sending them over... :really: 😑 

> Neia however... was starting to see the pieces crumbling apart. But she can't allow it, can she? She *is* the president.

**Neia:** Hehe… yeah. Maybe I didn’t think this through too much, did I? 😅 But you see, Urza... I was focusing on the suspicious nature of it all—

**Urza:** Stop, stop it. 😑 ✋ 

> Is... *she*?

 **Urza:** No need to keep embarrassing yourself further, “president”. 😑 Your loyalty to the girl blinds you, perhaps this is the very behaviour Inoi is so paranoid about. :sserio: If you keep doing this sort of biased charity act to someone that clearly doesn’t deserve it :really: you’ll end up destroying the very little group cohesion you *tried * to build. 🙄 

> She did this mission well, didn't she?

 **Urza:** If you want to improve at what you are doing, you really need to start rethinking your strategy. If you keeping doing things like you've being doing during Synthesis, you'll be doomed sooner or later.  :really: Think about it, will you? :sserio:

> Didn't... she?

**Neia:** I-I.. Sorry… 😓 

**Neia:** *I’ll try to not make that mistake again, I promise…*


[7/20/2025 7:36 PM] tastaturzvd
> But this call wasn't the only one that became treacherous. Over at the feeble reunion.. things were starting to exacerbate... 

> Erthoun was slamming his hands on the table. His temper was as unstable as a nuclear bomb about to explode.

**Erthoun:** Impossible! We have to stay there for 6 full months!?? 😠 What about our education!?? :derp: We won’t have time to prepare for Refinement school even if we go back!! :derp: :really:

> Yet Candanz on the other hand... remained stoic, calculating. Efficient. Panels of information filling her vision.

**Candanz:** Regardless of what happens in the program, you will be capable of doing what you must in order to continue your studies. :serio:

> But there was something off, something that he could sense that was in there. He just couldn't pinpoint what.

> Because he just felt...

**Erthoun:** I call for bullshit! 😡 💢  No way that’s true! :derp: What is that Nep of yours planning with all of this!? It just doesn’t make sense! :derp: We aren’t even on the rank, let alone in the elite necessary to participate in a program like this!! :really:  Don’t you know how complicated this will be for all of us!?? 💢 Only a dumbass like Azar could pull something like this out his ass! 😤 

> That the program, didn't seem to make any logistical sense at all.
> 
> But... she couldn't be bothered by that. The program had to be carried out.
> 
> So... if *logic* didn't see to be working out.
> 
> The *big guns* had to be deployed.

Candanz narrowed her vision and dismissed all the crystalline projections.

**Candanz:** So you are willing to lose this opportunity entirely? 😑  I could perfectly search for someone else to replace you. :serio: Might consider for instance, your “friend” Navara. :sserio: 

> Navara Surim... Erthoun's biggest rival... the woman turned his world upside down.
> 
> The girl that took him over just to throw him down to the river and watch him sadistically drowning down the stream.
> 
> If she gets in the program instead of him...

**Erthoun:** Uhhh!?? 😳 You *wouldn’t* dare. 😠

> The rules of the Meritocracy were clear to her. If he wouldn't comply, the person's profile had to be used against them. 
> 
> It wasn't a thing of dehumanizing, it was a thing of efficiency. If individual interests get in the way of a collective effort, it had to the suppressed.
> 
> It was protocol... even though she *hated* it. 

**Candanz:** I could. :really: The principal wouldn’t like it, but if you keep insisting you aren’t suited for the job then… I would only be forced to remove you from the program. :sserio:

> Because that's the only way she knew to obtain the desired results... when things weren't matching at all.

**Erthoun:** WHAT!? Can’t you just replace that failure of Leyna Aru instead if you want so much to replace someone!?? :derp:  I’m not incompetent, I’m saying this program makes no goddamn sense! 😤 

> And the dissonance... was unbearable.

**Candanz:** What makes no sense is that you keep making complaints and assumptions!!  :serio: 😠  Every variable has been taken into account for this program, it will be done either with or without you. :really: 💢  If you want an opportunity, you will have it here, declining this offer will not only tarnish your reputation, but also your *entire* curriculum, got it? 😠 💢

> There was no escape.

**Erthoun:** Rghhh…

> Until there was...


[7/20/2025 7:56 PM] tastaturzvd
**Norian:** So it was true.  😌 

> He. He was watching this entire time.

**Candanz:** Hm? Norian Amt, what are you doing here at this hour? 🤨  It is still not the agreed time. :sserio:

> In assessing all of those variables... making sure everything was in order.
> 
> She missed what was most important.

**Norian:** I figured you’d be here before the time comes, Ms. Korr. I know how “Master Tedu” operates. 😌 

> That no one *watched* what was unfolding.

**Candanz:** Are you here to discuss something? :sserio:

> He was merely there, coming to see if he could talk to his former's lover most trustworthy companion to assist him with this.

**Norian:** No, I heard it loud and clear.  😌  You will force us to do this anyway, aren’t you? I just wondered... why. 😇 

> But he came over to hear her *threaten* a student instead.

**Candanz:** (coughs) This is an important moment for Cintre’s history, the first program where students from our society have the opportunity to… interact with Lurian apprentices. :sserio:

> No one should be doing something like that...

**Norian:** Students from Luria? That sure sounds lovely. What else? 😊 

> Not especially an officer like Candanz Korr...

**Candanz:** Well, this program is meant for your group to learn from the Lurians and their customs... :sserio: 💦 

> The disciple of that oh so well renowned Naori Command nurid official...

**Norian:**  Uh-huh. How nice, is it not? 😊  The question is then... *what drove him*? :serio:

> The entire atmosphere changed in a microsecond, Candanz was out of words. 

**Candanz:** D-Drove him? :sserio: Could you specify who you are referring to? :really:

> Out of thoughts.

**Norian:** You know what I am referring to, “sis”.  😑 

> Her faced dropped. 
> 
> She knew this man.
> 
> She knew what his ideals were.

**Norian:** What drove a high ranking officer like Tedu Kas Omou to care for a little group with no rank standing and give them such a golden opportunity? 😊  Sounds like something too delicate for people like us to manage. :yaogo:

> And she knew... that he *now* had the upper hand.

**Erthoun:** 😳 That’s exactly what I am referring to!! :loco: 😤 

> But it doesn't matter.

**Candanz:** That matters not, what is important here is that you comply with the Nep’s call. :sserio:

> A soldier doesn't go down in battle... until their last breath.

**Norian:** Sure, of course. We are just some students, after all. :yaogo:  Fodder, perchance? Like how your “sister” and you were meant to be? :really:

> But what if your enemy knows your every piece of intelligence... your every base?

**Candanz:** Norian, if this is just your petty way to get back at her, I will be sure to have that thoroughly informed. 😠 💢

> Could you even win against that?


[7/20/2025 8:18 PM] tastaturzvd
**Norian:** Threatening, are we? :yaogo: I just thought it was kinda funny… the very same group she is in, being selected? :kthinking: It is not because of Azar... or Urza... nor Xicaru. :yaogo: Hell, your mentor even declined giving him the very thing that made his entire identity... :yaogo: wonder how *that* happened. :really:

> But she was cornered this time...

**Candanz:** If you don’t stop this instant… I- 😡

> Her own master had put her in a very bad position.

**Norian:** You’ll what? :really: I know exactly what’s going on, I see it, I can even savour it. :yaogo: Keit told your precious master she didn’t want him to leave for Luria, and he just couldn’t do anything but break his arm into submission. ☺️  Isn’t that what he always does? 🙄 

> And she knew well... that in such a battle... at such disadvantage.
> 
> There is no reason to fight.

> She remained shut... and allowed the silence to speak for itself.

**Candanz:** You’ll join this program... and won’t tell anyone about this. 😑 

> But for him this was confirmation.

**Norian:** So I’m right, go figure. :yaogo:

> A confirmation of his very and deepest fears...

**Erthoun:** WHAT!? Is this because of that *brat*!?? :o_O: 😠

> That he... was right all along.

**Candanz:** Listen you two, if I hear a word about Keit’s involvement in all of this, I’ll have your masters know that you compromise an exchange program planned by Tedu and Principal Iwa themselves that concerns our entire meritocracy. 😑 

The nature of what inspired this program does not invalidate its value nor its purpose, creating drama unnecessarily will be considered a major offence. :sserio:

> That the Meritocracy is all but a lie.

**Norian:** (chuckles knowingly) Alright, fine by me. 😊 

> That everyone is just doing everything for Keit... because she manipulates them to do so.

**Norian:** I’ve got all I ever wanted to hear, I’ll participate. :malote:

> And to him, that satisfaction... overruled everything else.

**Erthoun:** So it is all about Keithra, should have known.

> Seeing the castle of cards fall apart... the very system that had gaslighted him for years to make him think it was *his* problem...

> It was everything for him.

**Candanz:** You should be happy... :really:

> But to Candanz... it was everything but that...

 **Candanz:** You’ll both get what you want.... :really: 

> Because everything she cared about was Keit... she knew that what she was doing was hypocritical.
> 
> But that shouldn't matter to a soldier.

 **Candanz:** Luria is not only a place full of opportunity, but performing there will make you *legendary*. 

**Erthoun:** What? *Legendary*? 😳 

> What matters to a soldier is that every piece is in its place.

**Candanz:** Furthermore, Lurian society is nothing like ours, people there are more relaxed and lenient. Perhaps it is the class of utopia that you, Norian, ever wanted to see in our society. :sserio: :really:

> No matter the cost...

**Candanz:** I know this is not the most Cintrean way of handling things but, human interests are always influencing our behaviour. 😮‍💨 

> Even if what you are living in... is world made of cardboard.

**Candanz:** So, if it does favour us... :really:

> And that cardboard... it always to be cut for the artist's *masterpiece*.

**Candanz:** *why complain?*


[7/25/2025 10:35 AM] tastaturzvd
Back at the principal's dormitory, Leyna, Goura and Keit are sat on the floor as they observe the magnificence of a holographic simulation that was played out by Iwa. It was of the same kind that was given to Mr. Sayko on planet Luria, the two previously uninformed students were dumbfounded at the sheer complexity of it all. Leyna, having a small black and white crunchy piece of inflated dough similar to a muffin on her hand, bit a bite out of it amazed.

**Leyna:** (muffled)  *Woah… had no idea something like this was even possible…* :sfood: :cwhut: 

Goura touched his forehead, his veins throbbing, trying to process all the information, the principal stood near the hologram with a sly but confident expression.

**Goura:** So to summarise, we are all going to live in residency pots near their academy, and from there we have to write down our insights about what was our experience with the Lurians… including our frustrations, personal conflicts or even simple observations of their behaviour... :idea: Sounds, pretty simple... *too* simple even.  :maybe:  :serio:

Iwa stood there smugly, like a lawyer winning her case.

**Iwa:**  No need to think much about it, it is precisely *that*: a cultural exchange program.  :he: 💅

Leyna mumbled behind her piece of pastry, unsure.

**Leyna:** But… what is that thing of us… working together with a chosen Lurian? :kthink:  Who is that Lurian going to be? :e_e: :sus:

**Iwa:** Oh, need I explain myself again, Ms. Aru? 🤨

Leyna giggled nervously and hid her face behind her meal, Iwa chuckled.

**Iwa:** No issues there. 🤭 :yaogo:

The principal adjusted something on her floating own control panel, crystalline dust particles dancing around it as then the hologram morphed and zoomed into the hologram of Wega Academy, the flame of the candles nearby moving slightly. Keit, who still a jumble of nerves, looked away as she started to hug her own knees.

**Iwa:** Given that Wega Academy analyses their students very closely, we have the luxury of accurately assessing which student would be most optimal for each member of your group to interact with face to face. :sserio:

She snapped her fingers and two spheres, representing a student of Wega Academy with their profile in a silhouette and Keithra herself appeared on top of her hand, orbiting around each other like interlocked stars.

 **Iwa:** Each of you will be tasked to focus on that student, with its certain degree of leniency. You’ll do your projects with them and interact with them on a daily basis. :idea: 

She then crushed both spheres with her hand, both of them dissipating, Keit jumped slightly, startled. 

 **Iwa:** As to who that person is going to be? :kthinking: That will be revealed once you are established in Luria. :yaogo:

She then reformed the dust and an holographic projection of Luria appeared on her hand, rotating on its axis.


[7/25/2025 10:58 AM] tastaturzvd
Leyna took another bite off the muffin.

**Leyna:** So... we’ll... know about them on Luria? :e_e: 😅 

Iwa swirled the Luria hologram away.

**Iwa:** Yes! That is to have a genuine first impression experience from all of you. :idea:

Goura raised his eyebrows, considering her clarification.

**Goura:** Huh, that actually doesn’t sound that bad if you put it this way. :kthink: I really wonder how the life of a Lurian is. :serio: 

He puts his hand on his chin, rubbing it thoughtfully.

**Goura:** We already have plenty of cultural shock with Urza, Iluia and Hemo… :serio:

`Flashback snapshots of Urza with her book, Iluia with her tea and Hemo in his hangar`

**Goura:** ...this might just be completely mind blowing for most of us. :e_e:

Keit chimes in, her head still buried on her knees.

**Keit:** See guys? It’s a really cool project! 😅  Master Tedu had the idea, given that he was going to go to Luria very soon… 😓 

Goura nodded agreeably, Leyna kept munching on muffin looking at Keit.

**Goura:** Pretty brilliant, I must undoubtedly say. :serio: :kthinking:


[7/25/2025 4:38 PM] tastaturzvd
Leyna choked on the muffin and started coughing and hitting her chest.

**Leyna:** (coughs) *But…* (coughs harder) *Master Iwa...* :yao:

Goura started to quickly look for something  in his Great Link system.

**Keithra:** A-Are you alright Lyn? :e_e: 😅 

**Leyna:**  *You sure everything will be just about interacting with them? Is there any…* :idea:  (coughs) *evaluation criteria…*  (coughs) *or anything of the sort?* (coughs more) :yao:

Then suddenly a jolt of electrostatic energy created by Goura's palm puffed her hair like a hedgehog as he patted her back, the coughing is gone.

**Leyna:** *Eeeugh...* :yao: :yaonion::yfried:

Goura then pointed at her with her thumb.

** Goura:** She’s asking if we can fail at this thing… :yao: :yaonion: 

Leyna's shoulders slumped forward, the deflectors of her own system slowly rearranged her hair back to normal.

**Leyna:** Yeah… :yfried:

Iwa smiled and shook her head in disapproval, grabbing her head with the fingertips of her right hand.

** Iwa:** The only way you can fail this exchange program is by not behaving according to basic Cintrean or Lurian etiquette :yaogo:  and you’ve got to make sure *no ulterior motives* are involved in your assessments. :idea:

Leyna bit on her muffin again, she talked so softly it couldn't really be heard... unless you've got Cintrean technology at your disposal.

**Leyna:** *What ulterior motives...* (muffled) :yao: :csus:

Before Iwa could react though, Goura spoke over her.

**Goura:** Huh. Seriously? That’s it? Just stating our observations about their behaviour? :kthinking:


[7/25/2025 5:00 PM] tastaturzvd
The principal chuckled to herself, this was apparently very amusing to her.

>  She inevitably had them on her pocket, this was just an easy redaction on her report.

She proceeded.

**Iwa:** Your observations are simply statements of fact of events that happened in your time on Luria. :idea: 

`Flash to Candanz back at the reunion chamber, she was in her seat writing something with her right her hand on crystalline panel.`

 **Iwa:** Think of a log, state the obvious with information that can be corroborated. :yaogo:

`Then to Norian, who was simply look at the roof, leaning on his chair with his arms crossed.`

 **Iwa:** Now, you may also have a diary where you’ll write about your personal experiences... :yaoc: 

`Then to Erthoun, who was tapping with his fingers on the table, his faced frowned and his expression stiff.`

 **Iwa:** But these won’t be taken for explicit study, those may rather serve useful when assessing the interview you’ll be having with officials after the trial period ends. :idea:

`Flash back to Iwa's cabinet`

 **Iwa:** Your answers have to be truthful and procedural... :sserio:

She pointed a finger at Goura.

 **Iwa:** ...for the purpose of the exchange program is to inform the Meritocracy how **you**, as *Goura Honut*... :sserio: 🫵 

She pointed then at Leyna.

 **Iwa:** ...or **you** as *Leyna Aru*, see the Lurians from your point of view. :sserio:🫵 

Both Leyna and Goura's eyes widened and then looked at each other. Keit smiled sheepishly.

 **Iwa:** Everything has to be real and thoroughly justified: *this* is the core of the program. :sserio: 😌


[7/25/2025 5:32 PM] tastaturzvd
**Goura:** So we have to evaluate them on a professional basis…  :serio:

Iwa created a crystalline chair made out of  her own deflector's energy and sat there, took her mechanical cigarette and inhaled on it casually, blowing smoke all around. 

**Iwa:** Correct. Personal affirmations will be welcome, but not utilised for formal assessment. :yaogo: 💅 

Leyna gulped her last piece of muffin.

**Leyna:** Wow… this is a lot. :e_e: *I have no idea how the rest is going to react to this.* :derp:

Goura got near here and whispered:

**Goura:** (whispering) *I think Neia is going to have a heart attack just by looking at this hologram*. :e_e:

Keit intervened.

**Keit:** I-It’s much simpler than it seems! 😅 I-It’s just a more refined version of the C-Cultural Assessment Directives of the Command: Observe, Monitor, Interact and Evaluate. 😅  :idea:

Leyna looked more confused than before.

**Leyna**: The cultural assessment direc-wha!?? :derp: :dafuq: 

**Goura:** I don't think we all know what those directives are, Keit... 😅  

Keit immediately panicked.

**Keit:** Just believe me that it is not as awful it sounds, okay!? 😖 :derp:

Leyna extended her palm towards, asking her to stop.

**Leyna:** No no, it’s fine, Ky! I think I got it now... 😅   I can't help but feel that something is missing though... :kthink: :yfried:

The principal raised an eyebrow, cigarette in hand. 

**Goura:** Missing? :e_e: :serio:

**Keit:** W-What do you mean Lyn? 😅 

She thought for a while longer, trying recollect her thoughts.

**Leyna:** Hmmm… :yfried:  Oh right! :idea:

She pointed back at the principal.

 **Leyna:** Master Iwa, why us? **You**… haven’t answered that one yet. :idea: :yao: 🫵

Outro: <Scene with Leyna desperately wanting to get Wayra's attention on a photo room with analog photo all around moving from place to place flapping her arms around while she's casually ignoring her. Wayra then ends up putting one of those dark photos on Leyna's forehead, Leyna looks curiously up while Wayra simply smiles brightly>

Intro: <Image of Goura running an experiment on a lab with Herman, he pours some liquid on a flask but then Nayori enters the room. As soon as that happens, Goura's reaction explodes on Herman's face. Nayobi laughs evilly, Goura nervously and Herman just stands there like "*Why me?*" holding some glassware while covered in smoke and char like Willie E. Coyote.>

** Leyna:** Master Iwa, why us? :idea: :kthinking:

> The real question, why them? Why would would them all people be selected?

Goura started to ponder...

**Goura thinking:** (Right... she never told us why we were elected in the first place... it's so weird. :kthink: Wouldn't electing our group be grounds for favouritism? Our group's meritocratic rank isn't even on top 20...  and a mission such as this, going to planet like Luria... one the Command has barely any contact with... it'd be considered an extreme privilege. :serio:)

Iwa inhaled and blew smoke once again.
﻿
**Iwa:** Just think for a little longer, Ms. Aru. ☺️﻿  🚬﻿ 

Leyna's face twisted with utter confusion.

**Leyna:** Ehh!? :huh: :e_e: O-Okay :kthinking: :yaonion:

**Goura thinking:** (A little longer? What could she mean? :serio: Is she implying it's something... obvious? :e_e:)

The principal however, just tapped her cigarette on her own deflective shield through the top of her hand.

**Iwa:** What makes your group... more special than most? 😊 ﻿﻿
﻿
**Leyna:** Special!? :gah: Uhhh... :e_e:

**Goura thinking:** (She can't be thinking on any of our grades, can she? Even if geniuses like Azar or Urza are in our group, that wouldn't be any excuse to bring all of us. :serio: )

`Flash of Azar leaning on his own desk in Wega Academy along with its students and Urza entering in a classroom receiving high praise.`

**Goura thinking:** (Using the resources to bring, maintain and foster 15 students in a completely different planet... risking all the potential issues that could arise... it all seems so careless. :serio: )

`Flash to the possibility of one of Hemo's inventions causing a fire and subsequent mayhem.`
﻿
**Goura thinking:** (Luria is not equipped to handle the kind of hazards that conveys being an Utam... :serio:  )

`Flash to Sayko and Tedu getting in trouble with Lurian and Cintrean authorities.`

**Goura thinking:** (And the potential political suicide that it could mean to fail this project.. it would catastrophic! :e_e:)

`Flash to the principal moving her cigarette around confidently, and image of Tedu appearing right next to her.`

**Goura thinking:** (Just what kind of justification could she and Tedu be having to orchestrate all of this... who do they think we are? :sus:)

Leyna kept on thinking on an answer.

**Leyna:** Hmmm... I don't know. We are kinda... chaotic?  Like... the most unbalanced and weird team of them all? 😅  Not one of us work on the same thing! :yao: 

`Image of Zinda working on coding on a piece of crystal`

**Leyna:** Zinda works on crystalware programming...

`Image of Iluia looking closely at different white jars tapping on them and seeing their descriptions.`

**Leyna:** Iluia on pharmaceutics...

`Image of Neia talking with different people on a reunion.`

**Leyna:** Neia as a spokeswoman and diplomatic relations announcer... 

`Flash back to Leyna herself`

**Leyna:** Goura does mineralogy and chemistry, Ky does crystalware *engineering* and I do architecture! :yao: 

Goura and Keit looked away kind of embarrassed.  

**Leyna:** We are from very different backgrounds... 😅

Principal Iwa couldn't contain her laughter. 

**Iwa:** Haha... ☺️  Hahaha. 😂

Leyna quickly blushed and hid her mouth with both hands.

**Goura thinking:** (She's laughing!? :e_e: :huuh: )

**Leyna:** What!? W-Was what I said that far off!? :gah: 😅 

Iwa cleared her throat.

**Iwa:**  No, not at all. You sealed the materials shut. ☺️

**Leyna:** Wha-!? Wait a second… :e_e: Are you saying that the fact our dysfunctional team is dysfunctional is *precisely* what made Master Tedu elect us from the rest!?? :gah: :loco:

**Goura thinking:** (Seal the materials!? No way that's why... !! :gah: It's too risky!! :e_e:)

**Iwa:** I know what you may be thinking... wouldn't that be risky? People from different backgrounds interacting... causing drama... chaos that could spread? :yaogo:

 **Goura:** (That's exactly what I was thinking!! How does she keep doing it!? :loco:)

 **Goura:** Y-Yes... but wouldn't it be? :e_e:

She took another round of that good smoke.

> Time to clarify.

**Iwa:** Under normal circumstances... yes. :yaogo: 🚬  But these are not normal. :idea:  For starters... your group will not be allowed to use Levelling on public Lurian grounds... nor any kind of technology that upon observation by any Lurian would be instantly considered far too advanced. You are forced to live like they do... *in its entirety*. :sserio:

> Lurians must not fear us.

 **Goura:** That's... the opposite of safe. What if we are attacked? :e_e: Aren't there like people with Deconstruction powers? :e_e:

**Iwa:** Of course, if the situation demands it, you may use force... but only defensively. 😑 You may not worry about the Lurians' safety, they may be far less technological, but their Healing capabilities are sublime. If the situation comes to that, you may use both your Great Link system's first aid kit and their own health services. :sserio: This will counteract any possible altercations if you don't use lethal force... :idea: Which for the average Lurian should be anything above EL30. :serio:

> Must not betray us.

 **Goura:** I-I see :e_e: Azar and Zinda gotta be careful then. :yaoc:

**Leyna:** Y-Yeah but-! What about us? Why?  😅 

**Iwa:** (sighs) Your group is full of cultural richness and people from extremely varied backgrounds... this is what makes you most valuable for a program like this. :yaogo:  It not only provides the perfect mix to have the effectiveness of *several* exchange programs at once, but also amplifies the culture shock for more closed-in analysis. :sserio:

> Must see our profile, our nature.

**Goura:** Wouldn’t that affect the results? :serio:

**Iwa:** That’s why all of you are assigned one person to interact with. :sserio: We’ll have both a more general reaction to virtually everything the Cintrean Meritocracy has to offer, including common immigrants like Orions, Hatimans and Luthneans, in addition to a more specific one against each of your individual backgrounds. :idea: 

> That's the only way... they can learn to trust us. 
> 
> And you to trust me as well...

Iwa saved her electric cigarette on her clothing once more. She sighed and closed her eyes serenely. 

 **Iwa:** I know all of this seems overwhelming, but acknowledge how much effort your group has been giving. Your constitution is not fair against the competition, you said yourself Ms. Aru. 😔  However... this project... is the way your weaknesses can become your real strengths. ☺️ No other group qualifies as well as yours do, none is as rich or as varied as yours is, it is exceptional, but in a different... non-"meritocratic" way. :really:

**Leyna:** Ohhh... 😧

**Goura:** So... you admit that this program isn't really up with the rules? :e_e:

 **Iwa:** (sighs) It is not. 😔 Why do you think I had to keep everything secret? 😒 Your facets will prove to be most effective for the purpose of the program, yet the way it is presented, it would make no sense for most. 😔

Keit looked down to the floor.

 **Iwa:** But that doesn't remove the utility of your dynamic, especially in times like these... in times where people need to understand us, understand our humanity :idea: The chaos derived from putting polar opposites against each other can... derive into incredible outcomes. :yaogo:

**Leyna:** 😳 That... is that why...? 🥺 

**Goura:** And you hid her location for? :e_e:

Iwa crossed her arms, her voice sounded much softer than before, much less abrasive.

 **Iwa:** For protecting her... and protecting the program. 😔 

Leyna and Goura glanced at Keit, she looked like a beat down puppy.

 **Iwa:** Everyone would start questioning the nature of it, probably even amongst your peers. :really: 

`Flash to Xicaru`

 **Iwa:** And the Meritocracy is very strict when it comes to eligibility protocol, even to point of being downright absurd. 🙄 Just following the meritocratic scale instead of following the *actual* meritocracy it's supposed to follow. You may know a case or two where merit doesn't really equate to *deserving*.  :really: 

`Flash to Norian and Erthoun`

 **Iwa:** I know some of the people from your group will find this contradiction unacceptable... so Nep Kas Omou forced hand to make it a mandate.  I cannot allow such a precious opportunity go to waste just because of the ignorant indecision of a few. :really:  *This* is what you were all trained for. :sserio:

Goura was shocked at the principal's confession.

**Goura:** Wow... damn, Master Iwa... I. :e_e: I had no idea you had to go through all of this trouble for giving us this opportunity. 😅 

**Iwa:** It’s fine, it’s part of the work of being a principal. :yaogo: You don’t have to worry about trespassing the archives, I already knew that was a possibility given the circumstances. :really:

Leyna started to feel water well up in her eyes.

**Leyna:** So you think that... we are *special*? Like *actually* special? Th-That's why you made me join their group? Because **I** am too? 🥹 

Master Iwa smiled knowingly, perhaps genuinely even.

**Iwa:** Yes, you are. ☺️ This is the reality of this program, and why you were chosen for it. 😌

**Leyna:** 🥹 :T_T: 

**Keit:** Lyn... 🥺

 *Destiny is calling your name...*

Shift of scenery, Neia and Hemo were waiting in what seemed to be a large spherical room, a midway passage to a pathway that to its right, lead to an area teased as: "REUNION CHAMBER".  The president sat on a waiting couch that outlined the room leaning, her hands clasped together, back slouched forward. The mechanical humming of the crystalline vibrators above emitting light gave her unease, as she started tiptoe with her left foot anxiously.
﻿
Her inner voice reverberated as an echo through the room.
﻿
**Neia:** (Ahhhh... why did I think all of this was a good idea? Now everyone is going to think I am risking everyone's reputation *for the benefit of a few....* 😅 Ah for a Armam's glory, am I going to be keep being the president after this? If the principal decided to play the innocent, *we are all going to be screwed... hehehe...* 😖 😅 )

`Flash to Hemo using his computer to hack into the archives, a green jewel with a star metallic outline glowing and eerie green beside him.`

**Neia:** (And I risked Hemo on top of it all, **what was I thinking?** :derp: What if programmers figure out the liability, what if now they are going to send him to rehab because of me? Keit, Leyna... *even Omon's gonna hate me...* 😣  )

Hemo touched the president's shoulder, Neia shook in response like she's just been electrocuted.

**Hemo:** You look real nervous, prez.  🤨  Are you that certain spaceship’s gonna fall apart? :serio:

Neia processed his question for a moment with confusion, for then immediately after, softening her expression.

**Neia:** Goura only sent a message saying he’ll talk to us in the meeting.  😔  And… you just heard what many think about this announcement…  😅  This all feels like a very big bad idea, Hemo. 😓

**Keithra Kas Omou** (born **Keithra Vylie**) is a central character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A Cintrean student of the Utam Institute, her unique and tumultuous past places her at the very center of the Lurian-Cintrean Cultural Exchange Program, serving as the unwitting catalyst for the entire initiative. Her personal history is marked by a series of exceptions to the strict rules of the Cintrean Meritocracy, making her a subject of both intense interest and resentment.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and Family Conflict**

Keithra was born in September 7th, 2478 to the Cintrean scientists Uzom Vylie and Tamatha Ittai. While her mother was largely absent due to work, her father, Uzom, was a patient and loving parent. However, Uzom harbored a deep hatred for the Meritocracy's practice of separating families by mandating education through the Utam Institute. Believing he could protect his daughter from this system, he made the fateful decision to raise her himself, providing her with a "self-taught" education outside of official channels. This decision, while well-intentioned, indirectly triggered the tragic events that would define Keithra's youth.

#### **Military Conscription and Trauma**

Under Cintrean law, individuals who are not part of the standardized Utam Institute system are eligible for conscription by other ministries. As a result of her father's choice, Keithra was forcibly taken from him at the age of 9 (in the year 2487) and conscripted into the Fort Force.

She spent two years in the military before being "kicked out" in 2489, prior to completing her training cycle. When she was old enough to understand that her father's attempt to protect her had led directly to her traumatic military service, she felt profoundly betrayed and turned her back on him. His current whereabouts are unknown, with some speculating he is deceased.

#### **Mentorship under Tedu Kas Omou**

In 2490, at the age of 12, Keithra was encountered and subsequently adopted by the high-ranking Naori Command officer, Nep **Tedu Kas Omou**. Tedu, seeing a reflection of his own past struggles and motivated by a newfound paternal instinct, took personal responsibility for her education. He oversaw her **Synthesis** stage education himself, creating a bespoke curriculum for her within the Naori Command.

This arrangement was justified under the ongoing Norst War protocols. However, in the _Keindya_ timeline, the war's abrupt end in February 2492 removed the legal basis for Keithra's special internship. This forced Tedu to "unnaturally prolong" her position and seek a deal with **Principal Iwa** of Iris Academy.

To legalize Keithra's status, Iwa allowed her to join Iris Academy's "off-course" transitional program in September 2492. She officially enrolled in the Synthesis stage alongside a new cycle of students, including Neia Amaritan, in 2493.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Keithra is the central pawn in Principal Iwa's grand design. Iwa, aware of the timeline, anticipated Tedu's predicament years in advance. She used Tedu's need to secure a future for Keithra as the ultimate leverage to launch her ambitious Lurian project.

At the start of the story in 2496, Keithra has just completed her 6-year Synthesis education under Tedu's guidance. She is 18 years old and is now entering her **Refinement** stage, for which the [[Cintrean-Lurian Cultural Exchange Program | Lurian Exchange Program]] itself will serve as her practical application curriculum. Her unique background makes her a source of intense jealousy for peers like Xicaru Inoi, who feel she has unfairly bypassed the traditional meritocratic system.

### **Personality and Skills**

Keithra is described as being intellectually gifted and "smarter than the average person, perhaps by a significant margin." She is a "talent promise" within the Meritocracy and holds a **DX5 (Purple Medal)** in the Art of Essence Conversion, indicating a high level of combat and strategic capability.

However, her traumatic past has left her with significant emotional scars. She is prone to high levels of stress and anxiety, often isolating herself when overwhelmed. She relies heavily on the support of her friends, particularly Leyna Aru, and her deep, familial bond with her guardian, Tedu Kas Omou.

Curiosity: Keit has the "Kas" middle name family tag due to Tedu's mentorship line incorporating the Kas within its mentorship line as "Kas Omou". This would mean, if Tedu had a son/daughter, they'd technically be called: (insert name) Kas-Kas Omou.

Leyna Kas Aru

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Leyna_

![[Leyna Infobox 3.png | 350]]

- **Full Name:** Leyna Kas Aru
    
- **Born:** July 30th, 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre (Distean Prefecture)
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Rego Industry (Architecture & Design)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Anko Aru (Mother), Onmei Jun (Father)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage
    
- **Known For:** Architectural Design, Emotional Expressiveness, Loyalty to Keithra Omou
    

**Leyna Kas Aru** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. An architecture and design student at Iris Academy, she is the best friend of Keithra Vylie and serves as the emotional heart of their core social group. While struggling academically within the rigid Cintrean system, her intuitive creativity and fierce loyalty make her an invaluable and relatable member of the Lurian Exchange Program.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and Family**

Leyna was born in the Distean Prefecture of Cintre to a medical specialist father and a mechanical engineer mother. Unusually for Cintrean society, Leyna maintains a close, supportive relationship with her parents, particularly her mother, Anko Aru, who works at Iris Academy. This constant parental support has been a crucial anchor for Leyna throughout her education.

Her career choice is a fusion of her parents' influence and her own creativity. She was drawn to the engineering aspects of architecture taught by her mother but applies them through a creative, design-oriented lens.

#### **Navigating the Meritocracy**

Leyna's journey through the Utam Institute has been challenging. She suffers from neurodivergent conditions, including ADHD and dyslexia, which make her struggle with the theoretical and academic aspects of her studies. She has a deep-seated fear of failure and of disappointing her friends and family.

During her Synthesis stage, the pressure from her then-supervisor, **Omon Sava**, drove her into a state of depression. This event served as a catalyst for Omon's own transformation, and he has since become one of her most protective and supportive friends. Despite her academic struggles, Leyna has not yet earned a new mentorship lineage and retains her family name "Aru" alongside the family lineage indicative "Kas".

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Leyna's role in the program is that of the loyal friend and emotional barometer. She does not grasp the complex political games being played by her peers, operating instead on a more direct, surface-level understanding of events. Her primary motivation is to support her friends, especially Keithra. A pivotal future event in her character arc involves her rejection of Keithra's romantic feelings, a cultural misunderstanding that will force Leyna to mature and establish her own emotional independence.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Leyna is highly extraverted, expressive, passionate, and creative, but also hot-headed and emotionally sensitive. She is fiercely loyal to her friends but can be quick to anger when she feels they are wronged. She is not prone to holding grudges and forgave Omon for his past behavior almost instantly once he showed remorse.
    
- **Skills:**
    
    - **Intuitive Architect:** While she struggles with theory, Leyna possesses a powerful, natural intuition for architecture and design. She can _feel_ when a design is right and often enters states of hyperfocus, creating numerous innovative projects that she passes to Hemo and her mother for practical implementation.
        
    - **Emotional Intelligence:** Her greatest strength is her emotional honesty. She is adept at understanding the feelings of those close to her and providing comfort, though she lacks the analytical depth to understand their more complex motivations.
        
- **Relationships:**
    
    - **Keithra Omou:** Her absolute best friend. They share a deep emotional sync, and Leyna is her staunchest defender.
        
    - **Omon Sava:** Her protective "older brother" figure. She trusts him completely after he transformed from her tormentor into her greatest supporter.

	* **Hemo Kirskis IV:** She is more in contact with Hemo thanks to his connection with Keit. She sees him with admiration, as he reminds her a lot of her own mother.
	
    - **Xicaru & Norian:** She dislikes both of them intensely for the pain they have caused Keithra and often clashes with them.
        
    - **Azar Hikami:** She does not see past his trolling persona and views him simply as a "jerk."

Omon Sava

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Omon_

![[Omon Infobox 2.png | 350]]

- **Full Name:** Omon Sava (adopted), Omon Eium (former)
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Naori Command (SCC Trainee)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Drixyl Eium (Basis Mentor), Ayro Sava (SCC Mentor), Candanz Korr (Unofficial Mentor)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement (Senren) Stage; SCC Trainee
    
- **Known For:** Diligence, Loyalty, Transformed Leadership Style
    

**Omon Sava** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A trainee for the Naori Command's Supervision Call Center (SCC) and a student at Iris Academy, he begins as a rigid, protocol-driven supervisor for his peer group. His story is one of profound personal transformation, evolving from a cold enforcer of rules into the team's wise, empathetic "voice of reason" and one of its most reliable members.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and SCC Candidacy**

Omon's upbringing was typical for the Cintrean Meritocracy; his parents gave him to the state at age three. As a child, he was not sociable and felt a stronger connection to rules and authority figures, like his Basis mentor **Drixyl Eium**, than to his peers. His unwavering belief in protocol, his non-aggressive nature, and his diligence made him the perfect candidate for the Naori Command's internal police force, the SCC.

#### **The "Ruthless Supervisor"**

Omon joined the Utam Institute in 2490 but was transferred into Keithra's peer group in 2493. He was secretly tasked by **Principal Iwa** to act as her personal "control manager," a supervisor meant to assess the group's efficiency. Omon took this duty too seriously, emulating his diligent SCC mentor, **Ayro Sava**, and applying his training manuals literally. For about a year after the midterm exams, he acted as a "ruthless supervisor," applying immense pressure on students he deemed inefficient, most notably **Leyna Aru**.

#### **Transformation**

His methods ultimately drove Leyna into a state of depression. This failure shattered Omon's rigid worldview. Realizing he was the problem, he embarked on a deliberate and humbling path of self-improvement. He consulted with Principal Iwa, who gave him a new mission: to study the nature of true leadership and understand the importance of morale. He also sought feedback from his peers, including a crucial conversation with **Azar Hikami**, who advised him to genuinely listen to and understand the dissident perspective of **Norian Amt**.

This process led him to abandon his old "oath" to cold efficiency and forge a new one based on empathetic understanding. A critical part of his transformation was the discovery that connecting with people was not just a more effective strategy, but a personally fulfilling one. By helping Leyna, he became her symbol of hope and progress, a role that genuinely warmed him.

His departing mentor, Ayro Sava, respecting his student's growth, granted him the "Sava" lineage. Subsequently, **Candanz Korr** took Omon under her unofficial mentorship, which led to him working closely with **Keithra Vylie** and cementing the strong friendship between Omon, Leyna, and Keithra.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Omon acts as the group's unofficial emotional anchor and wise counsel. He is the one who successfully convinces the heartbroken Norian to join the mission, not by arguing, but by appealing to his core values and providing a logical framework for him to proceed. He is now one of the most loyal and reliable members of the team, dedicated to the well-being of his friends.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Omon is defined by his "all or nothing" diligence. Initially, this manifested as a cold, quiet, and unapproachable enforcer of rules who sealed away his own emotions. After his transformation, he applied that same diligence to empathy. He is now a humble, wise, and deeply respectful individual who has learned to integrate his emotional intelligence with his work, making him a far more effective leader. He is a man of few words, but those words carry immense weight.
    
- **Skills:** He is a trained SCC officer, skilled in observation, analysis, and protocol. His greatest skill, however, is his newfound emotional intelligence, which allows him to de-escalate conflicts and provide insightful, calming guidance.
    
- **Relationships:**
    
    - **Leyna Aru:** He is now a protective older brother figure to Leyna. Their bond is inseparable, forged from his remorse and his subsequent dedication to her well-being.
        
    - **Norian Amt:** Despite being ideological opposites, they share a deep, mutual respect. Omon earned Norian's trust by engaging with his philosophy with genuine intellectual curiosity rather than judgment, creating a safe space for dialogue.

Norian Amt

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Norian_

![[Norian Infobox 2.png | 350]]

- **Full Name:** Norian Amt (adopted), Norian Fynett (birth)
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Talz Field (Nature Preservation)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Yurian Fynett (Brother), Hatsu Amt (Mentor)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement (Senren) Stage
    
- **Known For:** Botanical Expertise, Anti-Meritocracy Philosophy, Past relationship with Keithra Vylie
    

**Norian Amt** (born **Norian Fynett**) is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A quiet, observant, and thoughtful student at Iris Academy specializing in biology and nature preservation, he is secretly a political dissident whose family was suppressed by the Yuhan Authority. His character is defined by a deep disillusionment with the Cintrean system and a tragic, failed romance with Keithra Vylie that has left him bitter and wary.

### **Biography**

#### **A Child of Dissidents**

Norian was born to a family of protestors associated with the **Talzean Parliament**, a movement that opposed the Meritocracy's control. His parents raised him and his older brother, Yurian, outside the formal Utam Institute system, hoping to give them a life free from its influence.

During the Norst War, the Yuhan Authority used an emergency law to silence internal dissent by forcibly conscripting the children of known dissidents. Norian was taken from his family and used as a **political hostage** to ensure his parents' compliance. After a period of "rehabilitation," he entered Iris Academy at the age of 15.

#### **Mentorship and a New Path**

Upon entering the Institute, Norian was defensive and unhappy. He found a mentor in **Hatsu Amt**, a kind Talz Field specialist who connected with the boy through a shared love of nature. Hatsu's guidance provided Norian with a sanctuary and a new purpose, leading Norian to adopt the "Amt" lineage in his honor. Norian's passion for botany became his personal act of rebellion—a way to connect with a system of peace and harmony that he felt was absent in Cintrean society.

#### **The Sanctuary with Keithra**

Initially, Norian was suspicious of his peers, viewing them as products of the system he despised. However, he slowly came to see their own struggles and humanity. He formed a particularly deep bond with **Keithra Vylie** after her friendship with Xicaru collapsed. Recognizing her as a fellow "pawn" who had been wronged by the system, he became her confidant.

Their shared disillusionment and love for nature blossomed into a nearly five-month romantic relationship. It began after Keithra, encouraged by her friend Leyna, approached Norian to talk about his work in the academy's biomass reservoir. For Keithra, Norian's quiet, non-judgmental attention was a refuge. For Norian, her kindness and unbroken spirit were a source of hope. Their sanctuary was built on deep conversations and shared passions; he encouraged her to take up her flute again, using his connections to create an excuse for her to practice in his garden. It was here that their friendship turned romantic.

#### **The Breakup**

The relationship was ultimately destroyed when their respective traumas collided. Keithra, out of her deep-seated insecurity and fear of failure, developed a habit of using her powerful guardian, Tedu Kas Omou, as an excuse to avoid accountability. To Norian, this was the ultimate betrayal. He saw her as bringing the manipulative power dynamics of the Authority—the very thing they were escaping—into their sanctuary.

The final argument occurred when Keithra, terrified of performing her flute for the final exams, used Tedu's name as an excuse to try and change the requirements. This act brought the system's authority directly into Norian's personal, natural space. Feeling his sanctuary had been defiled, he gave her an ultimatum to trust him and their shared purpose. When her fear paralyzed her, he ended the relationship, leaving him hurt and resentful.

The fallout from the breakup was immediate and logistically complicated. Prior to their separation, Norian had been roommates with both Keithra and Neia. To create distance and manage the emotional turmoil, Neia, in her capacity as group president, made the decision to have Keithra move into the apartment shared by her friends Leyna Aru and Omon Sava, where she resides until the very beginning of the story.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Norian initially refused to join the Lurian mission due to the fresh pain of his breakup with Keithra. He was convinced to participate by his friend **Omon Sava**, who appealed to his identity as a biologist and the unparalleled scientific opportunity Luria represented. His motivation is a mix of genuine scientific curiosity and a desire to find a new, "purer" sanctuary in Luria's nature, far from the influence of Cintre and the memory of his failed relationship.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Norian is quiet, observant, methodical, and deeply philosophical. He projects a calm exterior, but underneath lies a profound disillusionment with the Meritocracy, which he views as a manipulative lie. He is kind and empathetic to those he trusts but can be cold and cutting to those he believes are "playing the game."

* **Philosophy:** Norian's worldview is defined by his family's failed rebellion. He believes the Meritocracy is a fabricated "game" designed to pit people against each other for growth, while pretending to be a collaboration. He sees everyone, including himself and powerful figures like Tedu, as "pawns" who can be sacrificed by the "kings" of the Authority. His core belief is that the only way to achieve true victory is not to win the game, but to "beat the system that makes us play it" by finding one's own purpose and identity outside of what the Meritocracy assigns. For him, the peace and harmony of nature is the only authentic system.
    
- **Skills:** He is a talented botanist and biologist with a deep understanding of natural ecosystems. He is also a sharp observer of human nature, possessing a keen ability to analyze the motivations and psychologies of those around him.

Sathki Naeru

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Sathki_

![[Sathki Infobox.png | 300]]

- **Full Name:** Sathki Naeru
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Fort Force (formerly, conscripted)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Nora Naeru (Mentor/Adoptive Mother figure)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage
    
- **Known For:** Exceptional Essence Level, C-PTSD, Former Super-Soldier
    

**Sathki Naeru** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A student at Iris Academy and a former frontline soldier for the Fort Force, she is the most powerful member of the Cintrean team in terms of raw Essence Level. However, she suffers from severe C-PTSD as a result of a secret super-soldier program and the horrors of the Norst War. Her story is one of rehabilitation and the struggle to build a new identity free from the trauma of her past.

### **Biography**

#### **The Super-Soldier Program**

Sathki's life was dictated by the Fort Force from birth. An orphan of the Meritocracy, she was selected for a secret program designed to create the perfect living weapon. The program's goal was to artificially emulate the emotional detachment of Type III Essence Impairment Disorder (EID) by psychologically dissociating her core personality from her "work" persona, turning her into an effective, merciless killing machine. She was raised and forged within this military reality, indoctrinated with the sole purpose of defeating the Norst. This program likely included other high-potential children, such as Keithra Vylie, who was in the same facility for a time.

#### **The Norst War and Collapse**

During the Norst War, Sathki was a frontline super-soldier, achieving a peak Essence Level (EL) of 98. However, the immense psychological toll of her upbringing, combined with the horrors of the war, caused her to break. At age 12, the "dam" containing her suppressed emotions shattered, resulting in a catastrophic mental collapse and an uncontrolled release of her power. The experiment was deemed a failure.

#### **Rehabilitation and a New Life**

To stabilize her, a new limiter was applied to her soul, this time to contain her traumatic memories rather than her emotions. This left her with a form of amnesia, unable to consciously recall the details of her life before the Institute. She spent the first three years of her Synthesis stage (ages 12-15) in rehabilitation under the care of **Nora Naeru**, a kind Him Care psychologist. Under Nora's guidance, Sathki essentially started her life over, relearning how to feel and communicate. In honor of the woman who gave her a new life, she took the "Naeru" mentorship line.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Sathki's participation in the program is part of her ongoing rehabilitation. She is seeking a peaceful life and wants nothing to do with her military past. However, her incredible muscle memory for combat remains. Her current EL is 83, a limit imposed not by physical constraints but by a psychological block; using her full power feels too similar to her past trauma and risks triggering her C-PTSD.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** The "reborn" Sathki is kind, gentle, and socially awkward, despite not being a natural introvert. She avoids confrontation at all costs and is terrified of the person she used to be, whose memory haunts her in flashes and nightmares.
    
- **Skills:** She possesses the highest raw power potential in the group, with a peak EL of 98. Even with her self-imposed limit of EL 83, she is an exceptionally skilled combatant due to her ingrained muscle memory from years of Fort Force training.
    
- **Relationships:**
    
    - **Neia Amaritan:** Her closest friend and anchor. Their bond is built on a shared, unspoken understanding of trauma from the Norst War, and Neia is fiercely protective of her.
        
    - **Keithra Vylie:** Keithra initially feared Sathki, remembering the merciless child sergeant from their time in the same facility. They bonded only after a sparring match revealed Sathki's new, gentle nature. Their friendship remains friendly but superficial, as both prefer to leave their shared past buried.
        
    - **Azar Hikami:** In a rare display of empathy, Azar has deduced Sathki's trauma and avoids trolling her, a fact that makes others like Leyna jealous.
        
    - **Zinda Yue:** Sathki is wary of Zinda. On a subconscious level, she recognizes Zinda's "brokenness" from her EID as being uncannily familiar to her own trauma, which makes her uncomfortable.
        
    - **Yuha:** Her "brother" under their new mentor, Jun Ramous. He is a kind and supportive training partner whose own high Leveling (EL 71) provides Sathki with a safe but challenging sparring environment, helping her to reclaim her skills and see a brighter future for herself.


Zinda Yue

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Zinda_

![[Zinda Infobox 2.png | 300 ]]

- **Full Name:** Zinda Yue
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Rego Industry (Crystalware Engineering)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Wakari Yue (Mentor, deceased)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage
    
- **Known For:** Logical Mind, Crystalware Engineering, Essence Impairment Disorder (EID)
    

**Zinda Yue** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A brilliant crystalware engineer for the Rego Industry and a student at Iris Academy, she is a tragic figure whose life was irrevocably altered by a terminal illness. Formerly the charismatic leader of her peer group, she now operates with a profound emotional detachment, guided only by logic and the principles of her late mentor. Her unique condition and history make her a stabilizing, if stoic, presence within the Cintrean team.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and Leadership**

Zinda's early life was marked by exceptional promise. She was mentored through both her Basis and Synthesis education by the legendary Unmei programming guru, **Wakari Yue**, who instilled in her a strong set of core values. Zinda was the original president of her peer group, a compassionate, direct, and principled leader who skillfully held the disparate personalities of her friends together.

She formed unique bonds with the two most rebellious members of her group. She saw through the troublemaker persona of a young **Azar Hikami**, engaging in a playful, comedic rivalry while also being the only one to show him genuine empathy. She also earned the respect and loyalty of the stubborn Orion, **Hemo Kirskis IV**, by making a sincere effort to understand his culture. Out of deep respect for her mentor, Zinda chose to retain the "Yue" lineage even after Wakari's passing.

#### **The Collapse and EID Diagnosis**

Zinda's life changed catastrophically during her Synthesis midterm exams. Her mentor, Wakari Yue, passed away shortly before the exams began. Grief-stricken and feeling the immense pressure to honor her mentor's legacy as she was one of only 5 mentees of 37 that she instructed, Zinda became obsessed with her work. This intense stress caused her to dangerously overexert her essence, triggering a latent, nigh undetectable condition known as **Essence Impairment Disorder (EID)**, a state where her soul becomes too "brittle" to repair itself from strain after achieving a particular Essence Level, her case, EL34.

Her condition escalated with terrifying speed. In just four days, her illness progressed from Type I, to a manageable Type II that worsened her emotional state, to the irreversible and terminal **Type III EID**. The disorder culminated in a physical collapse that permanently severed her connection to her emotions, leaving her in her current detached state.

#### **Life After Diagnosis**

As a person with Type III EID, Zinda cannot use any essence-based technology, including the nanomachinery that connects most Cintreans to the Great Link. Her Essence Level is permanently fixed at 38. She relies on an external cybernetic implant in her arm for all communication and technological interaction. She was forced to relearn her craft as an engineer using older, non-essence-based equipment, a process in which her friend Hemo provided crucial help and support.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Zinda's motivation for joining the exchange is based on pure logic. Having accepted her terminal diagnosis, she is not driven by a hope for a personal cure. Instead, she sees the program as a logical and necessary step for the Meritocracy's advancement. The opportunity to study a new culture and its "Talents" is an intriguing scientific problem that aligns with her core values of improving the system through knowledge. While she understands the data gathered could hypothetically help others with EID, this is a rational observation, not an emotional hope.

### **Personality and Skills**

Zinda is a paradox, defined by the ghost of the person she once was.

- **Personality:** Before her illness, she was a charismatic and compassionate leader. Now, she is emotionally detached, processing the world through cold, hard logic. However, her actions are still guided by the strong, principled foundation her mentor built. She is direct, blunt, and unwavering.
    
- **Skills:** She is a brilliant crystalware programmer who has adapted her genius to work with older, non-essence-based technology. Her unique condition gives her an objective perspective on technology that other engineers lack.
    
- **Relationship with Azar:** She does not know the classified details of Azar's past but correctly intuits that he is hiding a significant trauma. She relates to his physical limitations and acts as the "unofficial Azar police," using physical hitting as a blunt, logical corrective to keep his chaotic nature in check, a remnant of her old leadership style.

- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)

- **Known Relatives:** Unnos Hikami (Handler/Guardian)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage; Independent Researcher
    
- **Known For:** Genius-Level Intellect, Cynical Nihilism, Classified Experimental Subject
    

**Azar Hikami** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. Officially an Independent Researcher for the Naori Command and a student at Iris Academy, he is secretly a living, classified experiment and a tragic relic of the Norst War. His cynical, nihilistic persona serves as a complex shield for a traumatic past and a secret, life-or-death mission, making him one of the most unpredictable and intellectually formidable members of the Lurian Exchange Program.

### **Biography**

#### **The Norst War Experiment**

Azar's life was defined by a secret, high-risk experiment conducted during the Norst War. Selected for his extraordinary intelligence, he was subjected to a procedure designed to artificially heighten his Essence Level (EL) to its theoretical maximum, in an attempt to create a "super-soldier", just like Keithra was.

The experiment was a paradoxical and catastrophic success. It imbued him with an immensely powerful, "fiery" soul but critically destabilized its container, causing literal brain trauma. To prevent his essence from shattering and killing him, his Leveling potential was deliberately and permanently crippled, capped at a mundane EL 17. His unique physical appearance—white hair, albino complexion, and startling orange eyes—is a direct result of the biological modifications required for this process. The procedure sacrificed his physical form for soul power, leaving him with extremely low stamina and physical weakness.

#### **A Ward of the State**

Deemed too valuable to discard but too dangerous for any standard role, Azar became a classified ward of the state. His former Basis mentor, Henran Vos, willingly gave him to the Fort Force for the "cause." After the experiment, he was assigned a cold, detached Naori Command handler, **Unnos Hikami**, who acts as his guardian and manages his unique abilities. Azar's official title of "independent researcher" is a formality created to manage him as a state asset. He functions as a human supercomputer for the Naori Command, capable of finding connections no one else can, but is limited to one-hour analysis sessions per day to prevent system overload. He cannot use most standard Cintrean technology and relies on a hidden, rechargeable battery to power his internal systems.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Azar's participation in the program serves multiple purposes. For Principal Iwa, he is an invaluable asset: an unfiltered observer whose nihilism makes him immune to propaganda, and an "agent of chaos" to test the group's cohesion.

For Azar himself, the mission is a cover for his own secret endgame. His true motivation is to find a cure for his own life-threatening condition and for the EID Type III terminal illness afflicting his friend, **Zinda**. He sees the "Talents" of Luria as a new, unexplored branch of science that might hold the key to stabilizing a soul's essence, and the exchange program provides the perfect opportunity to conduct this research away from the watchful eyes of the Meritocracy.

### **Personality and Skills**

Azar projects a persona of cynical nihilism, viewing the world and its struggles as trivial. He has built an ego based on his one remaining asset—his genius-level intellect—and sees himself as an "endgame player" observing novices. His primary mode of interaction is "trolling" and mockery, which he uses to keep others at a distance and to amuse himself.

Beneath this facade, he is a deeply traumatized and caring individual.

- **Relationships:** He bonds with **Xicaru Inoi** over a shared sense of being wronged by the system and mentors they feel were unjust. He finds the emotional expressiveness of others, like **Leyna Aru**, endearing and enjoys provoking their reactions as a way to feel connected.
    
- **Relationship with Zinda Yue:** His most complex relationship is with Zinda. Before her EID collapse, they shared a playful, antagonistic friendship where she, as group president, would comically chase after the mischievous Azar. He enjoyed her reactions, and she was one of the few who showed him genuine empathy, seeing past his troublemaker persona. Now, he is drawn to her current detached state as a fellow "broken" individual. His secret mission to find a cure is, in reality, a mission to restore the vibrant friend he remembers and lost.
    
- **Abilities:** His mind is his only weapon. He possesses a genius-level intellect, allowing him to function as a human supercomputer. However, he is physically weak and his use of this ability is strictly limited. His entire backstory is a classified secret, unknown to any of his peers. He is the only one capable of seeing the strings from the puppeteers that make up the meritocracy, seeing past even Principal Iwa's moves and long term strategies.

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Xicaru_

![[Xicaru Infobox.png | 320]]

- **Full Name:** Xicaru Inoi
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Naori Command (Diplomatic Relations)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Eri Inoi (Mentorship Lineage "Sister")
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage
    
- **Known For:** Strategic Boss, Entitled Personality
    

**Xicaru Inoi** is a key character and antagonist in the _Keindya_ timeline. A Cintrean student from Iris Academy, he is renowned for his "strategic genius" but is primarily defined by his egocentric personality and a deep, bitter resentment directed at his fellow student, Keithra Kas Omou. His character serves as a case study in how the Cintrean Meritocracy's high-pressure environment can foster entitlement and jealousy, making him a significant source of internal conflict within the Lurian Exchange Program.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and the "Inoi" Lineage**

Xicaru's early education took place under the tutelage of **Syliah Inoi**, a former Naori Command archivist turned educator. He was paired with **Eri Inoi**, who would become his long-term companion. Initially, Xicaru exhibited a deep-seated sexism, a defense mechanism born from his envy of the higher natural Leveling potential found in Cintrean women. This insecurity stemmed from his own "absurdly low" Leveling potential, which made his childhood dream of joining the Fort Force impossible.

Despite his prejudice, Xicaru's pragmatism led him to recognize Eri's exceptional talent for memorization and historical recall. He came to respect her abilities and designated her as his "right hand." In recognition of their effective, if complex, partnership, Syliah granted them both her "Inoi" mentorship lineage.

#### **The Idealistic Genius and Tedu's Mentorship**

Before his rivalry with Keithra began, Xicaru was a proud and energetic idealist. He held a profound, almost heroic admiration for the Meritocracy and its greatest figures, like Nep Tedu Kas Omou, seeing them as superheroes he could one day emulate. His ambition was combined with a desire to succeed in his "very own ways," showcasing an "out-of-the-box" thinking that mirrored Tedu's famed companion, Anton Farai.

This combination of earnest passion and strategic talent caught Tedu's attention. Around 2493, Tedu took Xicaru on as a mentee after he declined continuing with his former mentor Kamira Contor. This was likely a strategic move by Tedu to provide political cover for his primary focus: the non-standard education of his ward, Keithra.

#### **The Shattered Friendship and Descent into Bitterness**

Xicaru's relationship with Keithra began with genuine admiration. Based on official records, he believed her to be a true prodigy who had earned a Naori Command internship at a young age, and he initially praised her for this achievement. They were, for a time, friends.

The turning point was a tragic confession. Feeling guilty for her perceived poor performance and wanting to be honest with the friend who held her in such high regard, Keithra confessed her entire backstory to Xicaru. She revealed the truth about her father's defiance, her conscription due to her immense but unutilized Leveling potential, being "kicked out" of the Fort Force, and Tedu's intervention to save her.

For Xicaru, this confession was a devastating betrayal of his core values. The "prodigy" he admired was, in his eyes, a failure who had squandered her natural gifts and been rewarded for it through nepotism. This single event shattered their friendship. His resentment, which he could not voice without disrespecting Tedu, was displaced onto Eri, twisting their friendship into a controlling and abusive dynamic. He dedicated himself to proving his superiority over Keithra at every turn. He even when so far as to blackmail Neia to stop her from splitting him away from Eri.

The final breaking point was when Tedu bestowed the "Kas Omou" lineage upon Keithra. This public act denied Xicaru the ultimate prize he felt he was owed, cementing his hatred and solidifying his role as Keithra's bitter rival.

### **Personality and Skills**

Xicaru is a confirmed "strategic genius," possessing a brilliant tactical mind. However, this intellect is coupled with a powerful ego and a sense of entitlement born from the Meritocracy's competitive nature.

His core psychological driver is a profound insecurity about his low Leveling potential and his inability to join the Fort Force. This manifests as a general sexism and a specific, all-consuming envy of Keithra, whose natural gifts and subsequent rewards represent a personal and ideological insult to his entire value system.

He has a close bond with Azar Hikami, who shares a similarly low Leveling potential due to his medical condition. Despite his abusive behavior, he maintains a co-dependent relationship with Eri Inoi, who understands the pain of being denied a mentor's lineage and endures his anger out of a tragic sense of empathy and fear of leaving him behind.

Eri Inoi

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Eri_

![[Eri Infobox.png | 300]]

- **Full Name:** Eri Inoi
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Naori Command (Historical Archiving)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Xicaru Inoi (Mentorship Lineage "Brother")
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement (Senren) Stage
    
- **Known For:** Exceptional Memory, Historical Knowledge, Submissive Personality
    

**Eri Inoi** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A Cintrean student from Iris Academy specializing in historical archiving, she is a tragic figure defined by her complex relationships and a single, devastating choice that she is forced to perpetually relive. She serves as a lens through which to view the personal cost of the Meritocracy's pressures and the emotional fallout of the rivalries within her peer group.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life and the "Inoi" Lineage**

Eri's early education took place under the mentor **Syliah Inoi**, a former Naori archivist. She was paired with **Xicaru Inoi**, whose initial sexist dismissal of her eventually evolved into a grudging respect for her exceptional memory and historical knowledge. He came to rely on her as his "right hand," and in recognition of their effective partnership, Syliah granted them both her "Inoi" mentorship lineage. Like Xicaru, Eri was later denied a higher mentorship lineage upon completing her Synthesis stage, a failure she internalized with a quiet sense of inadequacy.

#### **Friendship and Betrayal**

During her time at Iris Academy, Eri formed a close friendship with **Keithra Vylie**. They bonded instantly over their shared introverted, insecure, and deeply caring personalities, as well as a mutual fascination with Old Earth.

This friendship was tragically destroyed by Xicaru. After Keithra confessed her true backstory to him, Xicaru's admiration turned to bitter resentment. He confronted Eri, demanding she choose a side: "HER OR ME!?" Terrified of being abandoned by her oldest friend and trapped by a long-standing, complicated loyalty, Eri chose Xicaru. This decision, which she immediately regretted, severed her bond with Keithra and left her with a profound sense of guilt and powerlessness.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Eri is a conflicted participant in the exchange.

- **Personal Motivation:** As one of the group's foremost experts on Old Earth, the opportunity to study a living society so similar to the 21st century is a dream come true for her.
    
- **Internal Conflict:** She is trapped in a situation she deeply regrets. She desperately wishes to mend her friendship with Keithra but is terrified of confronting Xicaru. She envies Leyna Aru's current closeness with Keithra and has internalized a sense of being "unneeded," resigning herself to a destiny of supporting Xicaru while secretly hoping for an escape that avoids direct conflict.
    

### **Personality and Skills**

Eri is introverted, insecure, and deeply caring, but she hides these traits behind an agreeable and submissive personality, a coping mechanism born from her fear of Xicaru. She lives in a state of constant, quiet sadness, haunted by the memory of her choice.

Her greatest asset is her exceptional memory. This is not a supernatural talent like those Lurians have, but a natural skill rooted in her neurodivergence; she is described as a "mild autist with a keen for memorization." This ability makes her an invaluable researcher and archivist. However, it is also a curse, as her perfect recall forces her to constantly relive the traumatic moment she betrayed Keithra's friendship, a memory that now defines her.

Goura Honut

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Goura_

![[Goura Infobox.png | 300]]

- **Full Name:** Goura Honut
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Naori Command (Theoretical Research)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Zermus Honut (Mentor)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement (Senren) Stage
    
- **Known For:** Mineralogy & Chemistry Expertise, "Perfect Cintrean" Persona
    

**Goura Honut** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A friendly and diligent theoretical researcher for the Naori Command, he is a student at Iris Academy specializing in chemistry and mineralogy. Goura represents the ideal product of the Cintrean Meritocracy: a passionate, rule-following specialist who is uncomplicated by the trauma that defines many of his peers. He serves as a crucial baseline against which the group's more volatile members can be measured.

### **Biography**

#### **An Ideal Cintrean Upbringing**

Goura's history is one of straightforward success within the Meritocracy. He has no unusual family background and earned his "Honut" lineage from his Basis and Synthesis mentor, Zermus Honut. He found his true calling in mineralogy and chemistry, fascinated by how raw, natural materials form the foundation of Cintre's most advanced crystalloid and essence-conversion technology. He is one of the original members of his peer group, having joined in 2490.

Unlike many of his friends, Goura has not been involved in any major conflicts or traumatic events. He is a "perfect Cintrean"—a passionate nerd with good grades who believes in the system and has his life "figured out."

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Goura's primary motivation for joining the exchange is pure scientific curiosity. For him, the mission is the ultimate geological field trip—a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to study the mineralogy and chemistry of an entirely new world.

His narrative function is to be the primary agent of **culture shock**. As a straightforward Cintrean nerd from a society with formal, archived information systems, he will be baffled and fascinated by Lurian culture, particularly its chaotic internet, social media, and video tutorials. His friendly but awkward attempts to navigate this new world will highlight the vast differences between the two societies.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Goura is friendly, outgoing, and collected, but can be naive. He is a rule-follower who is quietly disapproving of his more rebellious peers like Hemo and Azar, but he avoids direct confrontation. His defining trait is a passionate, almost concerning obsession with his work.
    
- **Skills:** He is a talented theoretical researcher whose success comes from diligence and passion rather than raw, top-tier genius. He is an expert in the chemistry and mineralogy that are foundational to Cintrean technology.
    
- **Relationships:**
    
    - **Leyna Aru:** He has a good friendship with Leyna, as they are two of the most emotionally genuine members of the group. However, being a rule-follower, he will not help her with her work if it is against regulations.
        
    - **Keithra Vylie:** He has a respectful co-worker relationship with Keithra. He admires her experience in the Command and believes she is deserving of Tedu's legacy.
        
    - **Xicaru Inoi:** They were good friends before Xicaru's fallout with Keithra. Now, their relationship is awkward, and Goura avoids him to prevent conflict.
        
    - **Zinda Yue:** He had a crush on Zinda before her EID collapse. He now feels awkward around her, as she is no longer the person he remembers.
        
    - **Urza & Illuia:** He is intimidated by Urza's noble status but is quietly attracted to Illuia's endearing and peaceful nature.


Urza Rin Ohm

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Urza_

![[Urza Infobox.png | 300]]

**Full Name:** Urza Rin Ohm
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Luthnean Hyperspace
    
- **Species:** Human (Luthnean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Jusnean Tribunal (Data Analysis), Rin Ohm Family
    
- **Known Relatives:** Wayn Rin Ohm (Grandfather), Kayd Rin Ohm (Father), Nis Rin Ohm (Half-Brother)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement (Senren) Stage; Secretly Disinherited
    
- **Known For:** Luthnean Nobility, Jusnean Accountant, High-Stakes Political Intrigue
    

**Urza Rin Ohm** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A Luthnean noble and a student at Iris Academy specializing in Jusnean law, she is a formidable and complex individual. Publicly, she appears to be a ruthless heiress fighting for her family's honor. In reality, she is the central, unwitting pawn in a tragic and misguided deception orchestrated by her own father to save her from their family's toxic legacy.

### **Biography**

#### **The Illegitimate Heiress**

Urza is the illegitimate firstborn daughter of **Kayd Rin Ohm** and a woman he loved but was forced by his family to abandon. As a result, Urza was raised under the constant scorn of her extended family, particularly her powerful grandfather, who viewed her as a stain on their noble lineage.

For most of her life, she was raised to believe she was the sole heiress of the Rin Ohm family. This, however, was a sophisticated lie. Her father, Kayd, wanting to spare her the crushing, abusive life of a Luthnean noble, secretly disinherited her in favor of her younger, legitimate half-brother, Nis.

#### **The Father's Gambit: An Exile of Misguided Love**

Urza's "mission" to Cintre is an elaborate gambit engineered by her father to secure her freedom. He used the political fallout from the Yutra Atre treaty as a loophole to get her accepted into the Cintrean Utam Institute. He framed this to his own family as a way to "get rid of a mistake," while framing it to Urza as her solemn duty to fight for her family's honor and her inheritance.

His true goal is to force her to build a new, independent life in the Cintrean Meritocracy, a place where her performance matters more than her bloodline. The intense pressure he applies is a cruel but calculated method to ensure she succeeds and can never return to the toxic environment he wishes to save her from.

#### **The Cintrean Counter-Gambit**

Cintrean authorities, particularly **Principal Iwa** and Urza's mentor **Xulran Doiru**, are fully aware of this complex situation. They are playing their own long game, allowing Urza's family to believe their plan is working while they cultivate Urza as a future Cintrean asset with unparalleled insight into a powerful Luthnean house.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Urza believes her role is to succeed at all costs to secure her inheritance and bring honor to her family, unaware that this inheritance no longer exists. She views the Lurian mission as a secondary objective, another opportunity to gather intelligence for her family's benefit. Unbeknownst to her, she is not fighting for her family; she is fighting for the new future her father has secretly chosen for her.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Urza projects the perfect image of a Luthnean noble: cold, judgmental, brutally blunt, and adhering to an etiquette of "manners and imposition." Her philosophy is to "crush your enemy before they crush you." This is a mask for a deeply afraid and confused girl who feels trapped by the immense pressure of her family's expectations. Her self-worth is entirely tied to her utility to others.
    
- **Skills:** She is a "fine warrior," skilled in elegant self-defense. Her primary training is as a **Jusnean Tribunal accountant, a role she uses to fulfill her perceived family mission.
    
- **Health:** She suffers from a hereditary heart condition that causes fatigue and shortness of breath, requiring constant management from her companion, Illuia.
    
- **Relationships:**
    
    - **Illuia Zu Xin:** Her lifelong personal assistant, doctor, and sole confidante. Illuia is unaware of the great deception and genuinely believes she is helping her "sister" fight for her birthright, making her unwavering loyalty and care completely pure.
        
    - **Keithra Vylie:** Urza views Keithra with intense jealousy and contempt. She sees Keithra as a "peasant" who unfairly inherited a prestigious lineage with minimal effort, representing the "spoiled brats" she despises and a direct insult to her own lifelong struggle.
      
       Why does she call her "peasant"? Because her origins are not publicly known, so she assumes she is just a Cintrean commoner that was taken by the Fort Force and then given an opportunity by Tedu.

Iluia Zu Xin

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Illuia_

![[Iluia Infobox.png | 300]]

- **Full Name:** Illuia Zu Xin
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Luthnean Hyperspace
    
- **Species:** Human (3/4 Luthnean, 1/4 Vhuluo)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Him Care (Pharmaceutics), Rin Ohm Family (Retainer)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Urza Rin Ohm ("Sister"/ Charge)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage; Personal Assistant
    
- **Known For:** Unwavering Loyalty, Empathic Abilities, Caretaker Heritage
    

**Illuia Zu Xin** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A Luthnean student at Iris Academy specializing in pharmaceutics, she serves as the personal assistant, doctor, and sole confidante to the former noble heiress, **Urza Rin Ohm**. Illuia's preternaturally calm and caring nature is a result of her unique heritage as a descendant of the "Caretakers," a subspecies genetically engineered by the Alphas of Old Earth for loyalty and service.

### **Biography**

#### **The Caretaker's Legacy**

Illuia is one-quarter "Vhuluo," a descendant of the Caretakers created during the Alphas' "Human Servitude Project." This project involved modifying the human soul to create a population with unwavering loyalty and a muted emotional spectrum, making them perfect servants. This heritage gives Illuia a natural state of peace and positivity, and a hypersensitive empathic ability to read the emotions of others with astonishing precision.

Recognizing these valuable traits, Urza's father, Kayd Rin Ohm, assigned the six-year-old Illuia to be his daughter's lifelong companion and caretaker.

#### **A Sisterhood Forged in Secret**

Though their relationship began as one of service, it quickly blossomed into a genuine and inseparable sisterhood. Illuia became the only person to witness the vulnerable, frightened girl behind Urza's cold, public mask. She dedicated her life to being Urza's emotional and medical life support.

In a profound display of their bond, Urza used her authority as heiress to grant Illuia the Luthnean surname-title **"Zu Xin"** (roughly "My shine") after Illuia saved her life. Crucially, Urza's respect for Illuia's agency—insisting she call her by name instead of "master"—allowed Illuia to develop a healthy sense of self, avoiding the self-destructive tendencies common to other Caretakers.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Illuia's official role is to accompany Urza as her personal physician, managing her chronic heart condition. Unbeknownst to her, she is also an unwitting accomplice in the great deception surrounding Urza's inheritance. Illuia genuinely believes she is helping her "sister" fight for her birthright and honor her family. Her loyalty is pure, and she is completely unaware of the complex political games being played by Urza's family and the Cintrean authorities.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Illuia embodies the core traits of her Caretaker heritage. She is calm, ever-cheerful, and endlessly patient. Her emotional spectrum is more muted than a regular human's, making her less prone to anger, jealousy, or sadness. Her primary driver is an unbreakable, non-possessive loyalty to Urza.
    
- **Skills:**
    
    - **Him Care Specialist:** Her agency is channeled through her loyalty. She chose to become a highly skilled **pharmaceutical specialist** for the express purpose of better understanding and treating Urza's illness.
        
    - **Innate Empath:** Her Vhuluo heritage grants her a hypersensitive ability to read and understand the emotions of others, making her a natural comforter and therapist.
        
- **Trivia:** She wears artifacts from Old Earth, passed down through her Caretaker lineage, which serve as a subtle clue to her true origins.


Neia Amaritan

_Image: Conceptual portrait of Neia_

![[Neia Infobox 3.png | 300]]

- **Full Name:** Neia Amaritan
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at start of program)
    
- **Home world:** Yutra Atre (formerly), Cintre (Resident)
    
- **Species:** Human (Half-Cintrean, Half-Hatiman)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Talz Field (Intercolonial Communications)
    
- **Known Relatives:** Dorus Ith (Father), Nunda Amaritan (Mother)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student, Refinement Stage; Group President
    
- **Known For:** Diplomatic Skill, Charismatic Leadership, Past Trauma
    

**Neia Amaritan** is a key character in the _Keindya_ timeline. A talented spokeswoman and the current president of her peer group at Iris Academy, she is a natural leader whose charismatic exterior conceals a deep and defining trauma from the Norst War. Her story is one of a leader grappling with the immense pressure to protect her friends, often forcing her to bend the rules of the Meritocracy and make devastating compromises.

### **Biography**

#### **Early Life in Yutra Atre**

Neia was born on Yutra Atre, a culturally rich Cintrean hub world. Her Cintrean father, Dorus Ith, was strict, while her Hatiman mother, Nunda Amaritan, encouraged her daughter's independence, a core value in Hatiman culture. Neia grew up a "kid of the streets," naturally extraverted and curious, forming a group of friends from many different cultures and quickly becoming their leader.

#### **The Norst Attack and Core Trauma**

Her childhood was shattered by a Norst attack on her home world. Tasked with evacuating her friends, a young Neia made a fatal error: trusting the official evacuation protocols over her own intuition, she failed to act, leading to the deaths of several children, including her first love, Motty. This event did not instill a fear of being betrayed, but rather a profound and crippling fear of _betraying_ the trust placed in her. This guilt became her core psychological driver.

#### **Political Exile**

After the war, her family's reputation was tarnished by the incident. When the Cintre-Hatima treaty ceded Yutra Atre to the Hatiman Kingdom, her parents made the difficult choice to send her into the Cintrean Utam Institute system, believing it was the only way to keep her safe and help her overcome her trauma. She officially enrolled in Iris Academy in 2493.

### **Role in the Lurian Exchange Program**

Neia is the group's president, a role she inherited from Zinda Yue after her EID collapse. Her leadership is defined by a fierce, protective loyalty.

- **Leadership Philosophy:** Haunted by her past failure, Neia's prime directive is to protect her team at all costs, even if it means bending or breaking the Meritocracy's rules.
    
- **The Blackmail:** This philosophy led her to cover for her friend, **Hemo Kirskis IV**, after discovering he used a stolen Orion artifact to cheat on his midterm exams. This secret was unwittingly revealed to **Xicaru Inoi** by a naive Keithra. When Neia later tried to intervene in Xicaru's abuse of Eri, he blackmailed her with this knowledge. Trapped, Neia was forced to back down, reinforcing her trauma of failing to protect a friend.
    
- **Motivation:** Her motivation for the Lurian mission is twofold: a genuine passion for her specialization in intercolonial communications, and a desperate need to redeem herself as a leader by successfully protecting her team on this high-stakes mission.
    

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Outwardly, Neia is a charismatic, confident, and highly sociable leader. Inwardly, she suffers from high stress, moderate depression, and perfectionism rooted in her past trauma. She is fiercely loyal and will do anything for her friends, but is compromised by the secrets she keeps.
    
- **Skills:** She is a master of social connection, a talented spokeswoman, and is knowledgeable about the cultures and languages of many different colonies.
    
- **Relationships:** She has a deep, supportive friendship with **Sathki**, built on a shared, unspoken understanding of their respective traumas from the Norst War. She earned the loyalty of **Hemo**, but their friendship is now strained by the secret she holds for him. She actively tries to manage the group's "problem children," but is hampered by Xicaru's blackmail.

- **Full Name:** Erthoun Charr
    
- **Born:** c. 2478 (Age 18 at time of departure)
    
- **Home world:** Cintre
    
- **Species:** Human (Cintrean)
    
- **Affiliations:** Utam Institute (Iris Academy), Naori Command (formerly, Theoretical Research)
    
- **Rank/Title:** Student
    
- **Known For:** Stoicism, Self-Centered Personality, Abstracts Specialization
    

**Erthoun Charr** is a former member of the Cintrean peer group featured in the _Keindya_ timeline. A talented theoretical researcher specializing in abstract physics and mathematics, his character is defined by a cold, stoic, and self-centered personality that was forged by a traumatic betrayal within the Meritocracy's hyper-competitive system.

### **Biography**

#### **The First Betrayal**

Prior to joining Neia's group, Erthoun was part of a higher-performing team at Iris Academy. However, he was bullied by his teammates, including his then-best friend, Navara Surim, for his "lower than normal performance." After the Synthesis midterm exams, he was unceremoniously kicked out of the group, a betrayal that taught him to view social connections as a "weakness" and instilled in him a ruthless, self-preservationist mindset.

#### **A New Group and a Quest for Vengeance**

Following his expulsion, Principal Iwa placed Erthoun in Neia's more chaotic group. His primary motivation from this point on was **vengeance**. He intended to use his new group's success to prove his superiority to the team that had discarded him.

This mission was immediately frustrated. He viewed his new teammates as a "bunch of dysfunctional amateurs or jerks" who were weighing him down and hindering his quest for payback. His stoic, narcissistic persona was a coping mechanism designed to keep his new, "incompetent" peers at a distance.

#### **Departure**

After the Synthesis exams, Erthoun saw an opportunity to strategically withdraw. Concluding that the group was a liability to his reputation and his goal of vengeance, he officially left, telling Neia he "didn't want anything to do with them anymore." He deemed them useless for his quest and discarded them just as he had been discarded.

### **Personality and Skills**

- **Personality:** Erthoun is cold, self-centered, defensive, and a bit of jerk. This is a learned behavior and a protective shield built after a deep betrayal. He believes emotional connection is a weakness and views his peers almost exclusively through the lens of their utility to his own goals.
    
- **Skills:** He is a highly intelligent student specializing in the competitive fields of **abstract physics and mathematics**. He is also surprisingly strong for a non-combatant, having trained his Essence Level up to a respectable **EL 51**.
    
- **Relationships:** Before leaving, his relationships were almost universally negative:
    
    - **The "Jerks" (Azar, Hemo, Leyna):** He despised Azar's attitude, saw Leyna as a weakling, and held extreme prejudice against Hemo.
        
    - **The "Disappointments" (Omon, Neia):** He was disappointed in Omon for his "soft" approach to leadership and viewed Neia as an unworthy president.
        
    - **The "Respectable" (Urza, Xicaru, Zinda):** He held a degree of respect for them due to their serious, work-focused attitudes.
        
    - **The "Crazy Bitch" (Sathki):** He admired Sathki's strength and they were friends for about a year. However, after he confronted her about her performance and witnessed her "soldier mode," which nearly got him killed, he kept his distance, viewing her with fear.

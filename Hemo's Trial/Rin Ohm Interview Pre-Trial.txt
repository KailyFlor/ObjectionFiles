RIGHT BEFORE THE EVENTS OF THE ACE ATTORNEY CROSSOVER

Jusnean accountant Urza Rin Ohm enters the room.

Rin Ohm: "Greetings, is it possible to enter now? I have other things to do."

Elian: Of course, please, come in. Welcome. I understand you have a busy schedule, so I assure you this will be as efficient as possible.

My name is Elian. Please, have a seat.

Just to get the formalities out of the way for our record, could you please state your full name and your current profession?

Rin Ohm: "Of course. I go by Urza Rin Ohm. I am of Luthnean heritage, so Urza is my first name, Rin is my family's Informality and Ohm their Formality. That's how it is structured, if you so happen to not know."

"I am a recently-licensed Jusnean accountant, but I still am a practitioner. This is due to being an Utam student too, currently in the cultural exchange program based on Wega Academy, an institution present in Wega near Ecuia City's metropolitan center, and co-managed by the Cintrean Iris Academy, seventh most influential education metropolis in the Meritocracy."

Elian: Thank you for that detailed introduction, Ms. Rin Ohm. The clarification on Luthnean naming conventions is very helpful for our records.

You mentioned you are still a student at the Utam Institute. For the record, could you please state your age?

And, having noted your heritage, could you also tell us where you were born and raised? Was it within the Luthnean Hyperspace?

Rin Ohm: "I am the equivalent of eighteen Lurian years of age. But if you need it too, I am also 5.6 Cintrean Takourine Cycles or CTKs or 24 Luthnean astronomical sets or ASTs."

"I was born in Rundevart on Ith Dathe, the Luthnean's Hyperspace's fourth landmass and one of Alninam's most important commercial and logistical epicenters after Yutra Atre, former cultural epicenter of the Meritocracy and Otama from the Hatiman Kingdom."

Elian: Thank you for the precision, Ms. Rin Ohm. Rundevart on Ith Dathe is now noted in the record. It's quite insightful to learn the different ways time is measured across the Alninam Network.

You've mentioned your heritage, and the name "Rin Ohm" seems to carry significant weight. For our context, could you tell us a little about your family?

Furthermore, you stated you're a student of the Cintrean Utam Institute. That must be a unique experience for someone of Luthnean heritage. Could you briefly walk us through your educational journey in that system? For instance, what was your experience like in the Basis and Synthesis stages of your education?

Rin Ohm: "The Rin Ohm heritage is particularly influential because of its past and its perseverance through the times of war and bloodshed. Our family comes from the colonizers of the planet, and stood firm in the face of conflict for centuries, attempting to not only protect the land and the people our noble pride protects, but also the very foundation of the sovereignty that reigns it so proudly."

"Rundevart is our glory and the heart of our progress and our might, a capital carved by stone and sorrow, by precision and ruthlessness. In a world where technology strives, humanity falls short, for the very thing that makes us great is also what make us weak. We must not crumble in the face of hardship, is it Our Oath and Our Voice."

"Now to answer your other question, I was sent to the Yutra Atre territory before it was formally ceded to the Hatiman Kingdom, even though in practice, it doesn't mean much for the planet itself. My father, Kayd Rin Ohm, desired me to utilize this political maneuver to enter the Meritocracy to expand our influence. To become formidable and understand the nuances behind it, for the Meritocracy itself is a puzzle that concerns us most."

"Our family line has worked with them for decades, but a formal bond was necessary to be established to truly cement our kinship. I am the link that brings the power of merit to our bloodline and thus strengthen our true honor."

Elian: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Rin Ohm. Your family's philosophy is quite profound, and your role as a link between your heritage and the Meritocracy sounds like a significant responsibility. It gives us a much clearer picture.

You've explained why you entered the Cintrean system, which is very helpful. If I may, I'd like to return to the how of your education for a moment. Our records on the Utam Institute are based on Cintrean norms, and we want to ensure we understand your personal journey accurately.

You mentioned you are a Jusnean accountant student. Was this the specialization you chose during your Synthesis stage?  I'd be interested to hear what that process was likeâ€”transitioning from the general studies of the Basis stage to such a focused and demanding field within the Cintrean system.

Rin Ohm: "I didn't formally enter Basis school, I was too old for that stage. I entered at the age of 5 CTKs directly to the Synthesis stage. The reason why I was chosen for that is because of my tenacity and my proficiency on understanding the nuances behind systems, and because it was what I desired to specialize in."


"I understand if it is found to be unnatural for you that a Luthnean noble such as myself would be so interested in the law of another land, but you have comprehend that for me, Cintrean law is not only the sea that you watch beyond the horizon, but the currents that move it. The Meritocracy is the third most influential superpower of the entire Network, what it does and what it serves is part of the delicate balance that maintains Alninam together as a collective."


"Keeping order within the Meritocracy is required for everything to work, especially in a society so carefully constructed as it is. My family depends on this balance, so it is perfectly understandable they send me for this very purpose, for me to understand the true nature behind the Cintreans, so I make the wisest decisions once I return for what its due."

Elian: Thank you for clarifying your entry into the Synthesis stage, Ms. Rin Ohm. It speaks to your capabilities that you were able to bypass the Basis stage entirely. Your perspective on the importance of Cintrean law and its role in galactic stability is also very enlightening for our records.

You've spoken about your family and your duty, but I'd like to ask about your personal experiences at the academy, if I may. You are part of a very diverse group of students in this exchange program, coming from many different backgrounds and ministries. How have you found navigating the social dynamics of this group, especially given your unique position as a Luthnean heiress?

In particular, the records mention an assistant who often accompanies you, Iluia Zu Xin. Could you describe your relationship with her? It would help us understand the social structures you are accustomed to.

Rin Ohm: "Group C9A is clear to be a social experiment set by the principal of our academy, Iwa Tsurim. Our backgrounds are too varied to be stable as an unit, and our dynamics are far too incompatible for there to be another reason why we are allowed by kept together."

"This is why I had no surprise the cultural exchange program was offered, our group was designed for something like that to occur, sooner or later. It is not that uncommon of principals to create groups that they know will serve specific functions within the Meritocracy once they reach full autonomy."

"As for my experience with them? I tolerate them, it is my duty to do so, but I admit some can get under my skin. President Neia Amaritan does her best trying to safeguard the situation, but in a group as dysfunctional as ours, it is oftentimes not possible."

"Though I must say that the cultural exchange program has solved a lot of problems regarding this fact. The locals have proved to be an impressive patch to most of our vulnerabilities as a team, and many of them have stabilized the issues that define our group, or even reinforced our strengths."

"So I will say that for what its worth, the cultural exchange program has been a success. If it wasn't for what Mr. Kirskis allegedly did, of course."

"About my assistant? Zu is not only my companion, but also my second hand. She helps me with duties I cannot muster and in case of a medical crisis, averts the situation immediately. She is a servant of the highest order and a person that deserves respect for what she does."

Elian: That is a very pragmatic way of looking at it. The idea of a student group being intentionally designed for a purpose like a cultural exchange is a very Cintrean concept, I think. It is also good to hear that the program has had a stabilizing effect on your group's dynamics, despite the current circumstances. And it's clear you hold your assistant in the highest esteem.

You brought up Mr. Kirskis, and that leads us to the central matter of this interview. You are present in the proceedings against him in a professional capacity.

For the record, could you describe your official role as the Jusnean accountant in the trial of Hemo Kirskis IV? And, based on your experience as his classmate, what is your personal assessment of him in relation to the charges he is facing?

Rin Ohm: "Mr. Kirskis is a former Orion pirate and a person that struggled to attach to the norms that define our Meritocracy. It is only natural that something like this would have happened at some point. On a personal capacity, I have disdain for the higher-ups that allowed Mr. Kirskis to be let in just as they did me, since his presence is a danger for the system that we so much want to protect."

"That being said, an accountant must do what they must, and my duties are that of following logic, data and evidence. If Mr. Kirskis is proven to be completely innocent of all charges, then good for him, I will admit that I misjudged him, but if the data finds him to be responsible for the charges Mr. Edgeworth has decided to accuse him for, then justice has to be served for the sake of all the intellectual damages and the life risk that carries the loss of that library."

"As a informal resident of this planet, I understand that Lurians value their knowledge deeply, so my accounting will vouch for what is fair, that is my job: to ensure proceedings follow Cintrean law and ensure that a just and timely verdict is reached in consonance with the Meritocracy's values of merit and fairness."

Elian: Thank you for that candid assessment, Ms. Rin Ohm. Your commitment to impartiality and the rule of law, separating your personal feelings from your professional duty, is very clear and has been noted for the record.

You mentioned the charges brought by Prosecutor Edgeworth.

As the Jusnean accountant, you are there to ensure the proceedings and accusations are sound and consonant with the law. Based on the initial evidence, such as the data retrieved from his robot, Trinket, did you find the case against him to be compelling?

Rin Ohm: "Mr. Edgeworth has done a great job as a prosecutor as far as I have spoken with him. I have no doubt his case is solid and the evidence will serve him well. As an accountant, I must align with what is most likely to mirror reality and serve as its defender. This is to maintain the cohesion of logic throughout the trial and barricade any possible deceiving attacks towards what is presented in front of us."

"So my apologies to you Lurians if I appear to side with him at the moment the trial starts. If Mr. Wright does not have evidence that contradict his narrative... my job as an accountant demands me to step in as an arbiter of law and data."

Elian: I see. Your role as a Jusnean accountant is to be an arbiter of law and factual accuracy, to ensure that the proceedings are guided by sound logic and evidence. We appreciate you explaining your function so clearly; it is a respectable and crucial duty in any legal system.

For the benefit of our Lurian record, then, could we establish that initial factual framework you will be defending? Could you please detail the specific charges Mr. Edgeworth has brought against Mr. Kirskis? I believe they include First-Degree Arson, Reckless Endangerment, and Destruction of Property.

And what was the compelling evidence he presented to initially support those charges?

Rin Ohm: "Trinket was found to initiate an energy pulse capable of burning a book with such intensity that it spread through the entire library in a matter of minutes. Since the sprinklers were found to be deactivated suspiciously the day of the fire, Mr. Edgeworth believes that Mr. Kirskis utilized the robot to deactivate them and thus commit full-scale arson."

"The motive he has prepared for this case is based on Mr. Kirskis' link with his past, as it is a known phenomenon of pirates that desire to come back to their roots that they burn down the life that had defined them before to demonstrate loyalty to their true allegiance."

"Mr. Kirskis' robot seems to align with this narrative, as well as the camera footage rescued from the library."

Elian: Thank you, Ms. Rin Ohm. That provides a very clear picture of the prosecution's initial argument: a deliberate act of arson, with the deactivated sprinklers indicating intent, motivated by Mr. Kirskis's desire to sever his current life and prove loyalty to his pirate clan.

On the other side, we have the defense attorney, Phoenix Wright. He is an outsider to both our Lurian and your Cintrean systems. What is your assessment of him and his methods, based on what you have been told?

Furthermore, I understand the first witness to be called is another student from your group, Leyna Aru. What is her relationship to the defendant, and what kind of testimony do you anticipate she will provide against the prosecution's narrative?

Rin Ohm: "I understand this is a risky maneuver from him, I am not sure if he is going to be allowed to call his own witness to the stand for his own cross-examination like he is planning... but it is Lurian law, it is not my ballpark."

"Mr. Wright has methods that are alien to what I am used to in my practices, it is inherently incompatible with most Cintrean proceedings. So it is most likely I will have to really pressure him within my capacity as an accountant. That is if he follows the regular tactics he is known for."

"Ms. Aru is clear to be a person that will paint the trial for what Mr. Kirskis appears to be as a person, they are friends after all. I am sure to be obliged to shut down that narrative, if that is what he is intending to push. I thoroughly hope that he will bring something with sustenance to the table Mr. Edgeworth and I are not aware of, that way the trial will run smoothly and we will be over with it before we know it."

Elian: Thank you, Ms. Rin Ohm. That gives us a clear understanding of your position and how you intend to approach the proceedings.

So, to summarize for the record: You see the prosecution's case as logically sound based on the initial evidence pointing to a clear motive. You anticipate the defense will rely on character testimony, which you, in your official capacity, will ensure is weighed against hard, factual evidence to maintain the integrity of the trial. Your primary goal is a just and efficient verdict that is consonant with the Meritocracy's values of fairness .

This has been incredibly informative. Your perspective is invaluable for our records and helps us better understand the complexities of this case. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. That is all I have for now. Thank you for your cooperation.

Rin Ohm: Marvelous. Your interview has been one of the most efficient ones I have come across on this planet, I must say I admire that. I will see myself off now. Farewell.

Elian nods respectfully as she stands.

Elian: Farewell, Ms. Rin Ohm. Thank you again for your time.
